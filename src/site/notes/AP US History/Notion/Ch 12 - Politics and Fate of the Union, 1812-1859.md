## 12-1: Jacksonianism and Party Politics

- Throughout the 1820s and 18302s, politicians reframed their political visions to appeal to an increasingly broad-based electorate

### Expanding Political Participation

- Property restrictions for voters, which states began abandoning during the 1810s, remained in only 7 of 26 states by 1840. Some states even allowed foreign nationals who had officially declared their intention of becoming American citizens to vote.

### Election of 1824

- Democrats: members of the party that emerged from Jefferson’s Republican Party as one of the two dominant parties in the second party system
- The Adams wing emerged in the National Repubnlicans and the Jacksonians becmae the Democrats; as an insurgent political force, they immediately began planning for 1828
- As president, Adams proposed a strong nationalist policy incorporating Henry Clay’s American System of program of protective tariffs, a national bank, and internal improvements
- Adams believed the federal government’s active role should extend to education, science, and the arts, and he proposed a national university in D.C

### Election of 1828

- Through a lavishly financed coalition of state parties, political leaders, and newspaper editors, a popular movement had elected the president. The Democrats became the nation’s first well-organized national party

### Democrats

- The Democrats represented a wide range of views but shared a fundamental commitment to the Jeffersonian concept of an agrarian society. They viewed a strong central government as antithetical to individual liberty, and they condemned government intervention in the economy as favoring the rich at the expense of artisan and ordinary farmers
- When it came to westward expansion, though, Jacksonians called for federal interventions, with Jackson initiating removal of Native peoples.
- Like Jefferson, Jackson strengthened the government’s executive branch even as he advocated limited government.
- Jackson commanded enormous loyalty and rewarded his followers handsomely.
- Spoils System: Practice of rewarding political supporters with public office
    - Although not the first president to do so - Jefferson had replaced many of John Adam’s appointees - Jackson’s own outcry against corrupt bargains made him an easy target for inflammatory charges of hypocrisy

### King Andrew

- Opponents mocked Jackson as “King Andrew I”, charging him with abuse of power by ignoring the Supreme Court’s ruling on Cherokee rights, by sidestepping his cabinet, and by replacing officeholders with his own political cronies
- Perhaps nothing rankled Jackson’s critics more than his frequent use of the veto which he employed to promote his vision of a limited government
    - He made the veto an effective weapon for controlling Congress, which had to weigh the possibility

## 12-2: Federalism at Issue: The Nullification and Bank Controversy

- The slave South feared federal power, and no state more so than South Carolina, where the planter class was the strongest and slavery the most concentrated.
- Southerners also resented protectionist tariffs which bolstered manufacturers by imposing import duties on foreign cloth and iron. In protecting northern factories, the tariff raised the costs of manufactured goods to southerners, who labeled the high tariff of 1828 the Tariff of Abominations
    - Tariff of Abominations: Protective tariff of 1828 that infuriated southerners and spawned the Nullification Crisis

### Nullification

- South Carolina’s political leaders rejected the 1828 tariff, invoking the doctrine of nullification, maintaining that a state had the right to overrule federal legislation..
- In 1828, Congress passed a new tariff, reducing some duties but retaining high taxes on imported iron, cotton, and woolens. Although a majority of southern representatives supported the new tariff, South Carolinians did not, insisting that the constitutional right to control their own destiny had been sacrificed to northern industrialists’ demands.
    - They feared the act could set a precedent for congressional legislation on slavery. In November 1832, a South Carolina state convention nullified both the 1828 and the 1832 tariffs. Declaring it unlawful for federal officials to collect duties in states.

### The Force Bill

- Jackson soon issued a proclamation opposing nullification. He moved troops to federal forts in South Carolina and prepared U.S. marshals to collect the duties. At Jackson’s request, Congress passed the Force Bill, authorizing the president to call up troops but also offering a way to avoid force by collecting duties before foreign ships reached Charleston’s harbor.
- The Tariff of 1833 was quickly passed by Congress and signed by the president. The new tariff lengthened the list of duty-free items and reduced duties over nine years. Satisfied, South Carolina’s convention repealed its nullification law.
- Nullification offered a genuine debate on the nature and principles of the republic. Each side believed it was upholding the Constitution and opposing subversion of republican values.
    - South Carolina’s leaders opposed tyranny of the federal government and manufacturing interests, while long term, they also sought to protect slavery.
    - Jackson fought the tyranny of South Carolina, whose refusal to bow to federal authority threatened to split the republic.

### Second Bank of the United States

- Through its twenty-five branch offices, the Second Bank acted as a clearinghouse for state banks, refusing to accept bank notes of any local bank lacking sufficient gold reserves. Most state banks resented the central bank’s police role.
    - Moreover, state banks could not compete equally with the Second Bank, which had greater reserves
- Many state governments regarded the national bank as unresponsive to local needs, and many western settlers and urban workers remembered the bank’s conservative credit policies during the Panic of 1819.

### Political Violence

- Although political riots and violence stood out for their proportions and intensity, voter intimidation and fraud - initiated by both Democrats and Whigs - characterized the second party system

### Anti-masonry

- Violence was a catalyst for the formation of the Anti-mason Party, which formed in upstate New York in the mid-1820s as a grassroots movement against Freemasonry, a secret male fraternity that attracted middle and upper-class men prominent in commerce and civic affairs.
- Anti-masonry, rooted in the deep American fear of concentrated power and conspiracy, soon developed into a vibrant political movement in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest.

### Election of 1832

- Democrats → Jackson, and Martin Van Buren (V.P.)
- National Republicans → Clay and John Sergeant
- Jacksonians denounced the Bank of the United States as a vehicle for special privilege and economic power, while the Republicans supported it as a pillar of their plan for economic nationalism

### Jackson’s Second Term

- Jackson began in 1833 to dismantle the Second Bank and to deposit federal funds in state-chartered banks.
- As Congress allowed the Second Bank to die, it passed the Deposit Act of 1836, authorizing the secretary of the treasury to designate one bank in each state and territory to provide services formerly performed by the Bank of the United States.
    - The act also provided that the bulk of the federal surplus be distributed to the states as interest-free loans beginning in 1837. Eager to use the money for state-funded internal improvements, Democrats joined Whigs in supporting the measure overwhelmingly
- Fearing that the act would fuel speculation, promote inflation, and thus undermine farmers’ interests, Jackson opposed. Before signing the veto, Jackson insisted on a provision prohibiting state banks from issuing or accepting small-denomination paper money
    - Jackson hopes that by encouraging the use of coins, the provision would prevent unscrupulous businessmen from defrauding workers by paying them in devalued paper bills

### Specie Circular

- The president then ordered treasury secretary Levi Woodbury to issue the Specie Circular, which provided that, after August 1836, only settlers could use paper money to buy land; speculators would have to use specie (gold or silver).
    - The policy proved disastrous, significantly reducing public land sales, which in turn reduced the federal government’s surplus and its loans to the states.
- Fearful that banknotes would lose value, people sought to redeem them for specie, creating a shortage that forced the banks to suspend payment.
- Congress repealed the circular, but the president pocket-vetoed the bill by holding it unsigned until Congress adjourned. Finally, in May 1838, after Jackson had left office, a joint resolution of Congress overturned the circular.

## 12-3: The Second Party System

- In the 1830s, opponents of the Democrats, including remnants of the National Republican and Anti-mason parties, joined together to become the Whig Party.
- From 1834 through the 1840s, the Whigs and the Democrats competed on nearly equal footing, and each drew supporters from all regions. The era’s political competition - the second party system - thrived on intense ideological rivalry

### Democrats and Whigs

- The two parties held very different visions of the route to national prosperity:
    - For Democrats, the West’s fertile and abundant lands were essential for creating a society in which white men could establish independent livelihoods and receive equal rights, freed from the undue influence of established slaveholders or urban cities.
    - Whigs pushed for industrial and commercial development within the nation’s current boundaries.
- The Whigs’ vision of economic expansion demanded an activist government, while Democrats reaffirmed the Jeffersonian principle of limited government.
- Whigs supported corporate charters, a national bank, and paper currency. Whigs generally professed a strong belief in progress and perfectibility, and they favored social reforms, including public schools, prison and asylum reform, and temperance.
- Democrats distrusted concentrated economic power as well as moral and economic coercion. Democrats embraced a motto of “equal rights,” alleging that the wealthy and powerful had often benefited from special favors

### Political Coalitions

- The Whigs’ support for energetic government and moral reform appealed to evangelical Protestants.
- Democrats’ promises to open additional lands for settlement - and to remove the Native peoples on those lands - attracted yeoman farmers, wage earners, frontier slave owners, and immigrants.
- The Whigs’ preference for a slower controlled settlement of western lands attracted groups as diverse as African American New Englanders and well-settled slave owners.
- In response to the American Antislavery Society’s petitioning campaign, the House of Representatives in 1836 adopted what abolitionists labeled the “gag rule,” which automatically tabled abolitionist petitions, effectively preventing a debate on the,

### Van Buren & Hard Times

- With banks refusing to redeem paper currency with gold in response to the Specie Circular, a downward economic spiral curtailed bank loans and strangled business confidence.
- Van Buren followed Jackson’s hard-money, anti-bank policies, proposing the Independent Treasury Bill, which became law in 1840 but which was repealed in 1841 when Whigs regained congressional control.
    - The independent treasury - so named for its independence from both the Bank of the United States and British capital - created regional treasury branches that accepted and dispersed only gold and silver coin; they did not accept paper currency or checks drawn on state banks, and thus accelerated deflation
- Whigs favored new banks, more paper currency, and readily available corporate and bank charters.
- Democrats favored eliminating paper currency altogether. Increasingly, the Democrats became distrustful even of state banks; by the mid-1840s, a majority favored eliminating all bank corporation

### William Henry Harrison and the Election of 1840

- The Whigs confidently approached the election of 1840 with a simple strategy: maintain loyal supporters and court independents by blaming hard times on the Democrats.
- Whigs wooed voters with huge rallies, parades, songs, posters, campaign mementos, and a part newspaper, *The Log cabin*
- They appealed to voters as well as nonvoters, including women, who attended their rallies and speeches, and women actively promoted the Whig cause

## 12-4: Women’s Rights*

- Some radical reformers, such as Fanny Wright, had long decried such inequality, but the movement for women’s rights did not pick up steam until the religious revivalism and reform movements of the 1830s.
- While revivals emphasized human equality, reform movements brought middle-class women into the public sphere.
- Angelina and Sarah Grimke: Southern-born sisters who were powerful antislavery speakers; later leaders of the women’s rights movement.

### “Slave Power Conspiracy”

- Slaveholders had gained control of the South by suppressing dissent. They had forced the gag rule on Congress in 1836 and threatened northern liberties. To many white northerners, even those who saw nothing wrong with slavery, it was the battle over free speech that first made the idea of a Slave Power credible.
    - The war with Mexico deepened such fears
- Many whites, North and South, feared that large land seizures would bring thousands of nonwhite Mexicans into the United States and upset the racial order.
    - Yet, despite their racism and such numerical exaggerations, many statesmen soon saw other prospects in the outcomes of a war of conquest in the Southwest

### Wilmot Proviso

- In August 1846, David Wilmot, a Pennsylvania Democrat, proposed an amendment, or proviso, to a military appropriations bill: that “neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall ever exist” in any territory gained from Mexico.
- The territories, Calhoun insisted, belonged to all the states, and the federal government could not limit the spread of slavery there. Souther slaveholders had a constitutional right rooted in the Fifth Amendment, Calhoun claimed, to take their slaves (as property) anywhere in the territories.
- This position (“state sovereignty”), which quickly became a test of orthodoxy among southern politicians, was a radical reversal of history.
    - In 1787, the Confederation Congress had discouraged if not fully excluded slavery from the Northwest Territory, and the Missouri Compromise had barred slavery from most of the Louisiana Purchase. Now, however, southern leaders demanded future guarantees for slavery
- Wilmot Proviso: A proposed amendment to an 1846 military appropriations bill that would have prohibited slavery in territories acquired from Mexico; though it never passed, it transformed the national debate over slavery
- David Wilmost sought to defend “the rights of white freemen” and to obtain California “for free white labor.”
- The vast majority of white northerners were not active abolitionists, and their desire to keep the West free from slavery was often matched by their desire to keep blak people from settling there.
- Fear of the Slave Power was thus building a potent antislavery movement that unified abolitionists and antiblack voters. At stake was an abiding version of the American Dream: the free individual’s access to social mobility through acquisition of land in the west. This sacred ideal of free labor, and its dread of concentrated power, fueled a new political persuasion.

### The Election of 1848 and Popular Sovereignty

- Democrats nominated Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan for president. Cass, a party loyalist who had devised in 1847 the idea of “popular sovereignty” - letting residents in the western territories decide the slavery question for themselves. His party’s platform declared that Congress lacked power to interfere with slavery’s expansion
- The Whigs nominated General Zachary Taylor, a southern slaveholder and war hero. The Whig convention similarly refused to assert that Congress had power over slavery in the territories.
- Among northerners, concern slavery led to the formation of a new party. New York Democrats committed to Wilmot Proviso rebelled against Cass and nominated former president Martin Van Buren.
- Antislavery Whigs and former supporters of the Liberty Party then joined them to organize the Free-Soil Party, with Van Buren as its candidate.
- Free-Soil Party: A political party that sprang from and represented the movement to prevent slavery in the western territories

## 12-7: Compromise of Armistice

- The new decade’s first sectional battle involved California. More than eighty thousand Americans flooded into California during the gold rush of 1849. With Congress unable to agree on a formula to govern the territories, President Taylor urged these settlers to apply directly for admission to the Union.
    - They promptly did so, proposing a state constitution that did not permit slavery. Because California’s admission as a free state would upset the Senate’s sectional balance of power, southern politicians wanted to postpone admission and make California a slave territory.

### Debate Over Slavery in the Territories

- Clay and Douglas hoped to avoid a specific formula, and in the idea of popular sovereignty they discovered what one historian called a “charm of ambiguity.” Ultimately Congress would have to approve statehood for a territory, but in the meantime it should allow the people living there to regulate their own concerns - Lewis Cass quote
- To avoid dissension within their party, northern and southern Democrats explained Cass’s statement to their constituents in two incompatible ways.
    - Southerners claimed that neither Congress nor a territorial legislature could bar slavery. Only late in the territorial process, when settlers were ready to draft a state constitution, could they take that step, thus allowing time for slavery to take root.
    - Northerners, however, insisted that Americans living in a territory were entitled to local self-government and thus could outlaw slavery at any time.
- Douglas realized that different majorities might be created for the separate measures. Because southerners favored some bills and northerners the rest, a small majority for compromise could be achieved on each distinct issue.

### Compromise of 1850

- The compromise had five essential measures:
    - California became a free state
    - The Texas boundary was set at its present limits, and the United States paid Texas $10 million in compensation for the loss of New Mexico Territory
    - The territories of New Mexico and Utah were organized on a basis of popular sovereignty
    - The fugitive slave law was strengthened
    - The slave trade was abolished in the District of Columbia
- At best, the Compromise of 1850 was an artful evasion. Douglas had found a way to pass the five proposals without convincing northerners and southerners to agree on fundamentals. The compromise bought time for the nation, but it did not provide a real settlement of the territorial questions.
- Furthermore the compromise had two basic flaws. The first concerned the ambiguity of popular sovereignty. Southerners insisted there would be no prohibition of slavery during the territorial stage, and northerners declared that settlers could bar slavery whenever they wished.

### Fugitive Slave Act

- The second flaw lay in the Fugitive Slave Act, which gave new - and controversial - protection to slavery.
{ #fb1ef5}

    - Fugitive Slave Act: Part of the Compromise of 1850, this controversial measure gave additional powers to slave owners to recapture slaves and angered northerners by requiring their complicity in the return of fugitives.
{ #d099fa}

- The law empowered slave states that a person owing them service or labor had become a fugitive. That claim would then serve as legal proof of a person’s slave status, even in free states and territories.
- The “free” states were no longer a safe haven for black people; an estimated twenty thousand fled to Canada in the wake of the Fugitive Slave Act

### The Underground Railroad

- Underground Railroad: A loosely organized route by which fugitive slaves escaped to freedom in the northern United States and Canada
- In Ohio, numerous white abolitionists, often Quakers, joined with black people as agents of slave liberation at vatious points along the river border between slavery and freedom.
- The Underground Railroad applied pressure to the institution of slavery and provided slaves with a focus for hope

### **Election of 1852 and the Collapse of Compromise**

- The 1852 election gave southern leaders hope that slavery would be secure under the new presidential administration
- Juries refused to convict the abolitionists who had stormed the Boston courthouse, and New England states passed personal-liberty laws that absolved local judges from enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act, in effect nullifying federal authority.

## **12-8: Slavery Expansion and Collapse of the Party System**

- Stephen A. Douglas, one of the architects of the Compromise of 1850, introduced a bill to establish the Kansas and Nebraska Territories. He did not view slavery as a fundamental problem, and he was willing to rick some controversy to win economic benefits for Illinois, his hometown
- A transcontinental railroad would encourage settlement of the Great Plains and stimulate the Illinois economy. Thus, with these goals in mind, Douglas inflamed sectional passions to new levels.

### **The Kansas-Nebraska Act**

- The Kansas-Nebraska Act: Repealed the Missouri Compromise and inflamed sectional disputes around the expansion of slavery in the territories. The act left the decision of whether to allow slavery in the new territories of Kansas and Nebraska up to the voters residing there (popular sovereignty)
- Northerners and southerners still disagreed violently over what territorial settlers could constitutionally do. Moreover, the Kansas and Nebraska Territories lay within the Louisiana Purchase, and the Missouri Compromise of 1820 prohibited slavery in all that land from latitude 36’30’ north to the Canadian boarder.
    - If popular sovereignty were to mean anything in Kansas and Nebraska, it had to mean that the Missouri Compromise was no longer in effect and that settlers could establish slavery there.
- His bill threw open to slavery land fromwhich it had been prohibited for thirty-four years.The struggle in Congress lasted three and a half months. Douglas won the support of President Pierce and eventually prevailed: the bill became law in May 1854 by a vote that demonstrated the dangerous sectionalization of American politics.

### **Birth of the Republican Party**

- The beneficiary of northern voters’ wrath was a new political party. During debate on the new Kansas-Nebraska Act, six congressmen had published an “Appeal of the Independent Democrats.” They thought that Douglas’s legislation was a violation and betrayal of their rights.
- During the summer and fall of 1854, antislavery Whigs and Democrats, Free-Soilers, and other reformers throughout the Old Northwest met to form the new Republican Party, a coalition dedicated to keeping slavery out of the territories.
- The emergence of the Republican coalition of antislaver interests is the most rapid transformation in party allegiance and voter behavior in American history

### **Know-Nothings**

- Republicans drew into their coalition a fast-growing nativist movement called the American Party, or the Know-Nothings.
    - Know-Nothings: Anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant party whose influence peaked in the mid-1850s.
- Democrats courted the votes of new immigrant citizens, but many native-born Anglo-Saxon Protestants believed that Irish and German Catholics would owe primary allegiance to the pope in Rome and not to the American nation.
- The Know-Nothings strove to reinforce Protestant morality (temperance movement) and to restrict voting and office holding to the native born.
- Like the Whigs, the Know-Nothings could not keep their northern and southern wings together on the issue of slavery’s expansion, and they dissolved after 1856.

### **Party Realignment and the Republicans’ Appeal**

- The Republicans appealed strongly to those interested in the economic development of the West. Commercial agriculture was booming in the Old Northwest, but residents of that region desired more canals, roads, and river and harbor improvements. Because credit was scarce, a homestead program attracted many voters → Republicans seized on these ideals

### **Republican Ideology**

- Any hardworking and virtuous man, it was thought, could improve his condition and achieve economic independence. Republicans argued that the South, with little industry and slave labor, remained backward
- Opposition to slavery’s extension had brought the Republicans into being, but they carefully broadened their appeal. Their coalition ideology consisted of many elements: resentment of southern political power, devotion to unionism, antislavery convictions based on free-labor arguments, moral revulsion to slavery, and racial prejudice.

### **Southern Democrats**

- In the South, the disintegration of the Whig Party had left many southerners at loose ends politically. The security of their own communities seemed at stake, and in the 1850s, most formerly Whig slaveholders converted to the Democratic Party
- According to the southern version of republicanism, white citizens in a slave society enjoyed liberty and social equality because black people were enslaved.
- Southern leaders also portrayed sectional controversies as matters of injustice and insult to the South’s honor and prestige. The rights of all southern whites were in jeopardy, they argued, because antislavery and Free-Soil forces threatened an institution protected in the Constitution.
    - The stable, well-ordered South was the true defender of constitutional principles; the rapidly changing North, their destroyer
- In the South, no viable party emerged to replace the Whigs, and as in the North, political realignment sharpened sectional identities.

### **Bleeding Kansas**

- The Kansas-Nebraska Act spawned hatred and violence as land-hungry partisans in the sectional struggle clashed repeatedly in Kansas Territory. Abolitionists and religious groups sent in armed Free-Soil settlers; southerners sent in their reinforcements to establish slavery and prevent “northern hordes” from stealing Kansas.
    - Conflicts led to vicious bloodshed, and soon the whole nation was talking about “Bleeding Kansas”
- During the elections for a territorial legislature in 1855, thousands of proslavery Missourians - known as Border Ruffians - invaded the polls and won a large but fraudulent majority for proslavery candidates.
- The resulting legislature legalized slavery, and in response Free-Soilers held an unauthorized convention at which they created their own government and constitution.
- In May, a proslavery posse sent to arrest the Free-Soil leaders sacked Kansas town of Lawrence, killing several people and destroying a hotel with a cannon.
- These passions brought violence to the U.S. Senate in May 1856, when Charles Sumner of Mass. denounced “the Crime against Kansas” → Since he was radical in his anti-slavery views he got beat by a cane by Representative Preston Brooks

### Election **of 1856**

- When Democrats met to select a nominee, they shield away from prominent leaders whose views on the territorial question invited controversy. Instead, they chose James Buchanan of Penn., whose chief virtue was that for the past four years he had been ambassador to Britain, uninvolved in territorial controversies
- The Republican candidate, John C. Fremont, famous as a western explorer, won those eleven free states and 1.3 million votes; Republicans had become the dominant party in the North after only two years of existence

## **12-9: Slavery and the Nation’s Future**

- In 1857, the Supreme Court entered the fray, took up this emotionally charged subject, and attempted to silence controversy with a definitive verdict

### **Dred Scott Case**

- A Missouri slave named Dred Scott and his wife, Harriet Robinson Scott, had sued for their freedom. Scott based his claim on the fact that his former owner had taken him for several years into Illinois, a free state, and to Fort Snelling in the Missouri Compromise, from slavery had been barred by the Missouri Compromise.
- In all likelihood, the quest to achieve “freedom papers” through a lawsuit - begun in 1846 as two separate cases, one in his name and one in hers - came as much from Harriet’s desire to sustain her family and protect her two teenage daughters from potential sale and sexual abuse as from the aging and sickly Dred.
    - The Supreme Court agreed to hear *Dred Scott v. Stanford* and decided to rule on the Missouri Compromise.
- In March 1857, Chief Justice Roger B. Taney of Maryland delivered the majority opinion of a divided Court. Taney declared that Scott was not a citizen of either the United States or Missouri, that residence in free territory did not make Scott free, that Congress had no power to bar slavery from any territory.
- The decision not only overturned a sectional compromise that had been honored for thirty-seven years, it also invalidated the basic ideas of Wilmot Proviso and popular sovereignty.
- The ruling seemed to shut the door permanently on black hopes for justice.
- Dred Scott Decision: Controversial 1857 Supreme Court decision that stated that no black Americans, whether enslaved or free, were U.S. citizens. It also declared that the Missouri Compromise had been unconstitutional because Congress lacked the authority to ban slavery in the territories

### **Abraham Lincoln and the Slave Power**

- Lincoln warned of slavery’s increasing control over the nation. The founders had created a government dedicated to freedom, Lincoln insisted.
- Countless northerners heeded Lincoln’s warnings, as events convinced them that slaveholders were intent on making slavery a national institution.
- By endorsing the South’s doctrine of state sovereignty, the Court had in effect declared that the central position of the Republican Party - no extension of slavery - was unconstitutional.

### **The Lecompton Constitution and Disharmony Among Democrats**

- For northern Democrats like Stephen Douglas, the Court’s decision posed a dilemma. Northern voters were alarmed by the prospect that the territories would be open to slavery. To retain their support, Douglas had to find some way to reassure these voters. Yet given his presidential ambitions, Douglas could not afford to alienate southern Democrats.
    - Douglas chose to stand by his principle of popular sovereignty, even if the result angered the southerners.
- In December 1857, Kansas voted on a proslavery constitution that had been drafted at Lecompton. Believing the election to be rigged, most “free states” boycotted the election, giving the proslavery constitution an overwhelming victory.
- The free staters, who controlled the territorial legislature, quickly called for a new referendum in January; this time, the proslavery forces boycotted, resulting in an overwhelming defeat of the constitution. Although evidence suggests that most Kansas opposed slavery, President Buchanan tried to force the Lecompton Constitution through Congress in an effort to hastily organize the territory.
    - Never had the Slave Power’s influence over the government seemed more blatant; the Buchanan administration and southerners demanded a proslavery outcome, contrary to the majority will in Kansas.

### **John Brown’s Raid on Harpers Ferry**

- Soon after the Congressional showdown on the Lecompton Constitution, the entire nation’s focus would be drawn to a new dimension of the slavery question - armed rebellion (John Brown the face of these rebellions)
- Brown believed that slavery was an “unjustifiable” state of war conducted by one group of people against another. He also believed violence in a righteous cause was a holy act, even a rite of purification for those who engaged in it.
- Most troubling to white southerners was their awareness that, though Republicans politicians condemned Brown’s crimes, they did so in a way that deflected attention onto the still-greater crime of slavery.
