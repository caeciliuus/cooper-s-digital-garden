### Democrats v. Whigs

| Democrats | Whigs |
| --- | --- |
| Pro agriculture | Suspicious of rapid westward expansion |
| More power to the states/people, less to the federal govt. | Interested in: industrial and commercial development |
| Strict interpretation of the constitution  | Activist government |
| More likely to defend slavery | Corporate charters, a national bank, paper currency |
| ‚Äúheirs of Jefferson‚Äù | Progress & perfectibility |
| In beginning, draw support from South & North, then eventually exclusively the South | Public schools, prison and asylums, temperance |
| See importance of the West, committed to Indian removal | Government can help special interests if it promotes general welfare |
| Against Congress creating corporate charters, a national bank & paper currency | Worry about ‚Äúexcesses of democracy‚Äù and preferred to see society ruled from top down |
| Against government involvement in moral & social reform ‚Üí ‚Äúgovernment that governs the best, governs the least‚Äù | Evangelical protestants |
| ‚ÄúEqual rights‚Äù ‚Ä¶ sovereignty of the ‚Äúpeople‚Äù | Coalition: AA New Englanders and well-settled slave owners in the Upper South |

### Manifest Destiny

- ‚ÄúTerritorial expansion was the action that tore the scab off the oozing wound of slavery‚Äù (ü§Æ)
- It is the country‚Äôs manifest destiny to expand the cotton ‚Üí the term is coined
- USA is invited by Mexico to move into Texas, maintain duel citizenship. Mexico ******(1)****** allows them to use slavery, ****(2)**** can self-govern themselves.
    - US citizens want autonomy, so they revolt against the Mexican government & became independent ‚Üí USA won‚Äôt annex it because no one wants to be on record supporting the expansion of slavery in the region
    - Polk runs for president, promises to buy California, take all of Oregon and a bit more, then annex Canada. If he gets the presidency, he‚Äôll complete all these things, then won‚Äôt run for re-election as long as he gets everything he wants
- Polk gets Oregon (Oregon Treaty), then annexes Texas, then Mexico finally sells California to the USA
    - Polk provokes a war against Mexico, causing America to invade Mexico, where they take Mexico cit

### Mexican War: 1846 - 1848

- Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo: US gains CA, NM, present day NV, UT, AZ, parts of CO and WY

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKRYLUlGlWc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKRYLUlGlWc)

- US paid claims to US citizens of $3.2 million (U.S citizens in Texas who have claims against Mexico for property damage), $15 million to Mexico
- Slave power conspiracy: North believes this is evidence that slave powers in the South hold too much power in the government ‚Üí in congress, judicial, executive. Concentration of slave power interest is what leads to the Mexican War
    - Wilmot Proviso: never passed, states that slavery cannot be allowed in any territory gained from the Mexican War. Whigs wanted to pass this b/c they know it wouldn‚Äôt pass, proving that the Mexican American War was a slave power conspiracy

### What to do about the territories

- Doesn‚Äôt extend Missouri Compromise line
- Calhoun‚Äôs State Sovereignty: says that individuals in each of the states have the right to use the territories equally (open to all American citizens) ‚Üí if a Michigander can move to California and bring their belongings with him (property), then a South Carolinian can do the same, with their property INCLUDING their slaves
- Free Soil Party (not abolitionist): wage labor, no slave labor but they‚Äôre not abolitionist
- Lewis Cass: MI state governor, uses idea of Popular Sovereignty ‚Üí people in territories can vote whether they want slavery or want
    - Charm of ambiguity: states that a territory‚Äôs population cannot vote until it becomes a formal state
        - South want this b/c they want slavery to be established first
        - North wants the vote at any time the territory has a population large enough to have a territorial assembly
- Gold Rush: young men setting off to CA to get gold, means that law and order needs to be implemented

### Compromise of 1850

- Slave trade abolished in Washington D.C
- Texas boundary set, Texas gets $10 million for territory lost to NM territory
- NM and Utah territories established by popular sovereignty
- Fugitive slave law strengthened (North responds w/ personal liberty laws)
    - Citizens can be deputized to join a search party for a runaway slave
    - $10 if a U.S marshal returns a fugitive to the South
    - There‚Äôs no requirement for a fugitive‚Äôs appearance, so free men from the North were being taken to the South to become slaves, even though they were born free
- Slave TRADE illegal in D.C

### It‚Äôs all coming apart: Kansas Nebraska Act

- Compromised compromises ‚Üí nation at this point has relied on the Missouri Compromise, however Nebraska and Kansas were slave states
- Stephen Douglas - Illinois Senator, wants to create a transcontinental railroad with a terminus in Chicago, has to gain southern support
    - Terminus in Chicago would anger the Southerners significantly, plus the RR would have to lay through Kansas, which isn‚Äôt settled
    - Kansas Nebraska Act: Douglas overturns the Missouri Compromise, making the South happy, who then approve the building of the RR
    - Douglas gets rid of the Missouri Compromise because Kansas & Nebraska territory wasn‚Äôt settled & it didn‚Äôt have a climate susceptible for slave-produced crops
- Border Ruffians (pro-slavery forces) cross over to Kansas to vote ‚Üí Kansas and Nebraska slave stance is to be settled by popular sovereignty

### Consequences of Kansas Nebraska Act

- End of the Second Party System/Beginning of the Third
- Whig party falls apart - Northern & Southern Whigs can‚Äôt work together
- Republican party born in 1854 (Coalition: Northern Whigs, antislavery Democrats, old Liberty Party/Free Soil Party, Know Nothings)
    - Free soil: no slavery in the territories, homestead acts, temperance, tariffs, internal improvements
    - Republicans fuck with nativism (anti-immigrant)
- Know Nothings took a strong stance on anti-slavery

### Bleeding Kansas/Bleeding Sumner
- Free Soil settlers clash w/ Border Ruffians in Kansas‚Äô own unique take on the Civil War
- The sacking of Lawrence, Kansas, and the actions of John Brown at Pottawatomie Creek (broad swords?)
- Charles Sumner, senator from MA caned by Rep. Preston Brooks of SC in the senate house
    - Event nicknamed ‚ÄúBleeding Sumner‚Äù
- Into this James Buchanan, a pro-slavery northerner, is elected president (it would‚Äôve been a good time for a strong president‚Ä¶ he was not)

### The Supreme Court Wades In

- Dred Scott decision - Chief Justice Roger Taney (7 to 2)
    - Scott not a citizen of the US or MO
    - Residence in a free state does not make you free
    - Congress has no power to bar slavery from any territory
    - African Americans have ‚Äúno rights which the white man was bound to respect‚Äù

### Meanwhile

- Proslavery forces tried to force the Lecompton Constitution through Congress, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state. It was fraudulent and not representative of the majority vote. Buchanan supports it, but it doesn‚Äôt pass. Border Ruffians tried to pass it
- John Brown‚Äôs Raid on the federal arsenal @ Harper‚Äôs Ferry: an unsuccessful attempt to start a slave revolution. It resulted in the death of 10 people, including two of Brown's sons, and Brown himself was later hanged for treason
    - ‚ÄúI John Brown am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away, but with blood‚Äù
