- At the republic‚Äôs birth, the North & South had more similarities than differences, but @ the War of 1812, things changed. Embraced economic progress, diverging from the intl. norm
    - North transformed into society with markets ‚Üí market society. Settlers were no longer self-sufficient
    - When European trade halted, entrepreneurs invested in domestic factories, causing more men & women to work for others in exchange for wages ‚Üí agricultural commercialization
    - With the cash that northerners earned, they bought goods they had once made for themselves

## 10-2: The Transportation Revolution

- Pre-War of 1812: natural waterways were most readily available/cheapest routes for people w/ goods but they could only travel downstream

### Roads

- Roads constructed during the colonial & revolutionary eras become unusable. Corduroy roads‚Äî tightly lined up logs to reduce dust & mud‚Äî didn‚Äôt work
- Some northern states chartered private companies to build turnpikes, expanding commercial possibilities after the revolution but not enough at all
    - Financing fell on states & private investors ‚Üí enthusiasm for building turnpikes outpaced $$$ and enthusiasm needed

### Steamboats

- Steamboat companies flourished on eastern rivers & Great Lakes. Carried timber & southern goods to New Orleans for export

### Canals

- Canals were rarely used till 1817 when DeWitt Clinton pushed for the Eerie Canal ‚Üí ran between Buffalo & Albany (363 mi)
    - Took 9 years to build & once built, the Eerie Canal relied on child labor.
    - Once completed, the Eerie Canal was very successful. By 1840, canals totaled 3300 miles. Though by midcentury, many canals were abandoned (though the Eerie Canal continued to prosper

### Railroads

- By 1860, the US had 60,000 miles of track, most built in the North. Era began in 1830 but long distance service wasn‚Äôt available until the 50s
    - There was a lack of standardization, PA and OH railroads had multiple different track widths
- Northern states invested in railroads much more than southern states did ‚Üí PA and NY accounted for half of all state monies invested.

******************Map 10.1:****************** major roads, canals and railroads, 1850

### Regional Connections

- Northern use of canals & railroads unified states together ‚Üí nearly all produce from the Old NW floated down the Mississippi to New Orleans.
    - Internal improvements hastened westward migration: news, visitors and luxuries regularly traveled to previously remote areas of the NE & MW
    - Invention of the telegraph made compression of distance & time even starker

### Ambivalence Toward Progress

- Northerners claimed that building canals & railroads completed God‚Äôs design for the continent. Some, though, decried the enormous number of Irish canal diggers & track layers, who they deemed inferior
- Also hurt nature ‚Üí when streams were rerouted, swamps drained, forests fell, natural habitats ruined. People were deprived of waterpower, fisherman found their sources of food & money dried up

## 10-3: Factories & Industrialization

- As transportation improved, the Northeast‚Äôs manufacturing & commercial expansion did too ‚Üí western farmers supplied raw materials, created larger domestic market for goods manufactured in the NE

### Factory Work

- Specialization turned skilled craftsmen into laborers: traditionally each butcher carved an entire pig but now **each worker** ******************************************************performed a particular task****************************************************** as the pig traveled down the assembly line
- *Q:* ************is the U.S‚Äôs early industrialization processes & quick forming revolution responsible for the culture around work seen in the modern culture surrounding working ‚Üí ex: French work culture  v. U.S work culture: vacations. Is this due to the fact that the U.S underwent a revolution itself whereas the French acclimated to the changing work around them?************
- The bell governed work ‚Üí laborers never saw owners or final product of their labor. Workers lost their autonomy in impersonal market forces.
- American System of Manufacturing produced mechanized interchangeable parts that didn‚Äôt require ind. adjustment to fit.

### Textile Mills

- Mechanization was most dramatic in textiles, esp. in New England due to near water sources. The region‚Äôs rudimentary mills developed into modern factories
- Women were made up over half of cotton mills‚Äô employees in the mid 1840s. Managers recruited New England farm daughters, who were paid & housed in dormitories ‚Üí  Waltham Plan of Industrialization
    - Waltham system gave farm girls opportunities to socialize or earn wages, or CONSUME OTHER GOODS.
- Rhode Island Plan employed by Slater was more common: mills hired entire families, lodged in boardinghouses. Men often worked farm plots near the factories while wife & children were in mill

### Labor Protests

- To increase productivity in mills during the 1837 depression, managers sped up machines and required workers to operate more of them. Lengthened hours, cut wages, tightened discipline, packed boardinghouses
- Workers organized; in the Lowell mills, they unsuccessfully ‚Äúturned out‚Äù twice. Lowell Female Reform Association formed
    - Male workers also protested changes & unlike women, they could vote. Labor political parties formed in PA, NY, MA ‚Üí advocated free public education, end to imprisonment for debt, and opposed banks/monopolies
- Worker turnover weakened organizational efforts, and slowly fewer daughters entered the mills. In the 1850s, Irish immigrant women replaced them

### Labor Unions

- Courts provided organized labor‚Äôs greatest victory: protection from conspiracy laws
    - When shoemakers organized, employers accused them of criminal conspiracy, the courts acknowledged the laborers‚Äô right to organize yet viewed strikes as illegal
- *********************Commonwealth v. Hunt:* ruled that Boston bootmakers could strike ‚Äúin manner as best to subserve their own interests‚Äù ‚Üí set a precedent
- First unions represented journeymen in printing, woodworking, shoemaking, tailoring. Resembled medieval guilds.

## 10-4: Consumption & Commercialization

- By the 1820s and 1830s, much clothing was mass-produced for sale in retail stores

### The Garment Industry

- Market expansion created demand for mass-produced clothing, with the biggest market being the South. With the textile industry‚Äôs success raising price for cotton, planters bought clothes for their increasing # of slaves
- Retailers often bought goods wholesale, though many made shirts in their own factories
    - Garment industry took form of metropolitan industrialization: form relying on reorganization of labor rather than mechanization. Sweatshops? !

### Specialization of Commerce

- NY was a stop on every major trade route b/c of the Eerie Canal ‚Üí traders were intermediates for southern cotton & western grain
- Merchants w/ complex transactions required a large staff: @ the bottom were messenger boys, then copyists, clarkes, bookkeeper, confidential chief clarke.
- Commerce specialized faster in cities than in small towns, where merchants still exchanged goods w/ farm women

### Commercial Farming

- Transportation revolution & market expansion turned subsistence farms into commercial enterprises ‚Üí by the 1820s, eastern farmers cultivated nearly all available land & small farmers were ill suited for important innovations, so they moved west or worked in factories
    - In 1820, 33% of all western produce was intended for the market but by 1850, the number surpassed 50, allowing farmers to shift toward specialization & market-focused production
- Many NE  farmers faced competition from the MW farmers after the opening of the Eerie Canal, so they raised livestock

### Farm Women‚Äôs Changing Labor

- Rural women assumed more responsibilities: increased production of eggs, dairy, garden produce, bees
- Farm women & children often abandoned time-consuming spinning & weaving to buy factory produced cloth and produce more marketable products ‚Üí mixed-agriculture farm

### Rural Communities

- Not all farmers abandoned old practices  but by the 1830s there were fewer people at events in rural communities. Many young women left for textile mills & young men worked as clarkes or factory hand
- Farmers became more likely to reckon debt in $$$: kept tighter accounts & watched intl. markets closer

### Cycles of Boom & Bust

- Prosperity stimulated demand for finished goods, leading to higher prices & higher production but also land speculation. When production surpassed demand, land and stock values collapsed. NE was particularly hurt
- In 1837, the year after the 2nd Bank of the US closed, intl. savings & foreign investments sharply declined and banks couldn‚Äôt repay their depositors. Panic of 1837 lead European (üá¨üáß) to become suspicious & withdrew $$$ from US

## 10-5: Families in Flux

### The ‚ÄúIdeal‚Äù Family

- Separate-sphere ideology: middle-class ideal developed in which men functioned in the public sphere while women oversaw the domestic sphere
    - Women nurtured & guarded the family‚Äôs morality, making sure capitalism didn‚Äôt invade the private sphere
- Catharine Beecher‚Äôs *****************Treatise on Domestic Economy***************** approached housekeeping as a science & viewed a mother as a moral guardian. Believed that once married, women belonged at home

### Shrinking Families

- These new ideals depended on smaller families in which mothers could offer children greater attention. Parents could afford to have fewer children because they no longer played an important economic role
    - Women bore 7 or 8 children in 1800, then 5 or 6 by 1860
- Few northern women could fulfill the separate sphere ideology, as most wage-earning women provided essential income for their families and couldn‚Äôt stay home ‚Üí saw ideals as oppressive

### Women‚Äôs Paid Labor

- Unmarried girls & women worked as domestic servants or in factories while married & widowed women worked as laundresses, seamstresses, cooks; others earned wages in the putting-out system
- Middle-class Americans sought to keep daughters home. Catharine Beecher campaigned for teaching-training schools for women

## 10-6: The Growth of Cities

- No period in American history saw more rapid urbanization than 1820 - 1860. % of people living in urban areas grew from 7 ‚Üí 20%

### Urban Boom

- As new cities sprang up, existing ones grew greatly. From 1820 - 1860:  ******(1)****** NYC population went from 123k ‚Üí 813k, ******(2)****** Philadelphia population multiplied ninefold, ******(3)****** Rochester NY population grew from 300 ‚Üí 9000 people (1815 - 1830). Cities also expanded geographically

### Market-Related Development

- Whereas southern cities were almost exclusively seaports, many inland cities in the North were born (1820 - 1860)
- Northern cities had elaborate municipal services but lacked adequate tax power to provide services for all. Many tried to charter private firms, though they lacked the capital to build adequate water systems

### Extremes of Wealth

- Despite hopes that American industrialization wouldn‚Äôt the negatives of European industrialization, American industrial cities soon resembled European ones.
    - There were many factors leading to widespread poverty: ******(1)****** poor wages, ******(2)****** inability of many workers to secure a full-time job, ********(3)******** increasingly employment of women & children ‚Üí drove down wages
- In NY, where workers lived, conditions were crowded, unhealthy & dangerous ‚Üí families took in lodgers to pay the rent. Streets in poor neighborhoods were filthy & disease spread
- Between the 2 extremes of wealth sat a distinct middle class ‚Üí businessmen, traders, professionals. They enjoyed new consumer items, had large houses, and formed the backbone of urban clubs & societies

### Ethnic Tensions

- Native-born workers blamed immigrants for scarce job opportunities and low wages; middle-class whites blamed them for poverty & crime
    - Natural-borns considered the Irish & AAs morally inferior, however the groups didn‚Äôt develop solidarity & riots erupted between the two
    - Anti-Catholic riots occurred frequently: priests were attacked & churches vandalized in Philly
- German immigrants fared better b/c they were Protestants. They were stereotyped as hardworking, self-reliant and intelligent . Immigrants often lived in ethnic enclaves

### People of Color

- By 1860, 250,000 AAs lived in the urban north. Often felt racial solidarity ‚Üí African Methodist Episcopal Churches helped forge communities
- White racism was prevalent in all AAs‚Äô lives: could be turned away at any business, couldn‚Äôt enter public buildings,
- AAs were excluded from factory & electrical jobs. Women worked as house servants, cooks, child nurses,.. Men worked as construction workers, porters,.. Some worked in more stable lower-paying jobs, and others worked as sailors and seamen
- AAs became targets of urban violence.  White rioters would club & stone them, destroying houses, churches, businesses ‚Üí Philly had the most violence

### Urban Culture

- A working-class youth culture developed on the Bowery (entertainment strip) & ‚ÄúBowery boys‚Äô‚Äù greased hair, distinctive clothing & swag frightened many middle-class NY-ers
    - The Bowery boys drove middle-class citizens to establish private clubs ‚Üí Masonic order (all men): private club w/ hierarchy, harmony, shared values
- Urban recreation & sport became formal commodities, causing the all-sports newspaper *Spirit of the Times* and the Knickerbocker Club to be created.
    - A theatre was often second public building constructed in town, catering to different classes ‚Üí Shakespeare was popular

## 10-7: Revivals and Reform

- Revivals spread throughout the nation raising hopes for the Second Coming of Jesus ‚Üí called the Second Great Awakening. Tried to purge sin from the U.S to ready for Christ‚Äôs return
    - Revivalists strove for large-scale conversion; rural peoples traveled long distanced to camp meetings to listen  to fiery sermons

### Revivals

- Lyman Beecher & Charles Finney were the most prominent preachers during the revivals. Argued that evil was avoidable & anyone could achieve salvation. Revivalism thrived among Methodists & Baptists
- Burned-Over District: area in upper NY that experienced rapid transportation & industrialization, causing fear of social disorder
- Northern revivalist preachers emphasized the importance of good works, igniting many of the era‚Äôs social reform movements throughout the country
    - Benevolent empire: evangelically inspired reform associations receiving financial resources from the wealthy

### Moral Reform

- Reformers spread their message throughout the NE and MW via new technologies, creating cultural connections.  Reformers attended annual conventions & contacted like-minded people
- Wives & daughters solicited new members & circulated petitions, allowed them to exercise moral authority outside of the household
    - Sought to spread cult of domesticity  ‚Üí rather than only providing moral guidance to their children, women would establish reformatories & asylums
    - Many female reformers attended a female academy, which had equal education to that of men‚Äôs institutions
    - The Female Moral Reform Society had 555 chapters across the country & entered the political sphere

### Penitentiaries

-
