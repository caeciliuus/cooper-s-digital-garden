## Chapter 1: The Colonial Era
- #### Spanish model of colonization
	- Crown rules colonies autonomously
	- Men comprise most of the colonies & take native women as their wives
- #### Columbian Exchange
	- Europe → Americas: smallpox, domesticated animals, sugar, wheat, rye
	- Americas → Europe: corn, potatoes, tobacco, beans, squash, peppers, cacao  
	- ![Columbian Exchange | 500](https://faculty.chass.ncsu.edu/slatta/hi216/lectures/columbianexchange_files/columbianexchange_1.GIF)

- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Syncretism:</mark> practice of connecting Christianity to native religions
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Black Legend:</mark> banned the use of enslaving natives in the colonies, causing Africans to be used instead
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">House of Burgesses:</mark> first colonial congress
{ #78b565}

- #### English Reformation
	1. Martin Luther creates list of problems in the church, primarily sale of indulgences
		- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Covenant of grace:</mark> protestant belief that one can go to heaven only if they believe in God
	2. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Henry VIII</mark> creates Church of England so he can get a divorce 
	3. Elizabeth I is tolerant of other faiths, brings reformation to the church
	4. Stuart Cousins <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">James</mark> & <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Charles I</mark> seceded Elizabeth
		- No religious tolerance, believes in divine right of kings → begins Great Puritan migration
	5. Puritans that stay in England rise to overthrow Charles & begin the English Civil War. Charles is overthrown
	6. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Charles II</mark> begins restoration, gives US land to his supporters (proprietorship)
	7. James II takes power after Charles II dies w/o an hear. Glorious revolution begins (James dips → France) & constitutional monarchy is created
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Puritans:</mark> wish to get rid of Catholic influence, no more iconoclasm, separate from government, elect members of Church
- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">John Winthrope:</mark> first governor of New England, created the model of Christian charity
	- Created idea that the Puritans are in a deal w/ God: he let them survive the journey over so they must be the best Christians possible for him (or hell will come?)
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Manifest Destiny:</mark> American territorial policy stating it was the people's duty to settle, conquer and prosper throughout the continent. 
{ #13767f}

- Roger Williams buys RI, which he turns into a community based on religious tolerance, receives protection from English govt.
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Mercantilism:</mark> economic theory with heavy government involvement/stewardship in the economy. States that the world's wealth is finite: one nation gains, another loses #economy
	- England sets this system up 2 ways: used colonies for cheap, raw materials then overcharge them for finished goods
- Mercantilism created the <mark class="hltr-pink">Atlantic Trade</mark> → USA sends cheap materials to England, receive overly-expensive manufactured goods in return #economy 
	- Slavery supports the trade: slaves, the materials they produce and the materials they require to survive are all traded
- Decrease in indentured servants available because **(1)** there's competition of where they will move and **(2)** England sends less indentured servants to the colonies
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Bacon's Rebellion:</mark> pivot point, marks the movement from indentured servants → African slaves. Indentured servants and slaves team up to burn Jamestown to the ground. Results in the government creating a race-based hierarchical system that'll prevent slaves from revolting #rebellion
- ![Triangular Trade | 500](https://cdn.britannica.com/12/189412-049-D5A55A4F/flow-triangular-trade-Europe-slave-goods-North.jpg?w=740&h=416&c=crop)
- #### Steps taken to develop precept of black inferiority
	1. Establish black inferiority
	2. Establish white superiority

- #### Navigation Acts
	- Set of rules created in England to restrict colonies from having a free economy #colonialTyranny
	1. Only English colonial merchants & ships can trade within colonies
	2. Certain BNA goods can only be traded within empire
	3. All foreign goods imported into colonies must step into English part to be traded
	4. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Vice Admiralty Courts</mark> created → those who were tried for smuggling were forced to be in an English court w/o a jury. Violates the Magna Carta  #colonialTyranny 
	- Colonies don't follow the rules so James II makes all the colonies into one large royal charter: <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">The Dominion of New England</mark> #colonialTyranny 
	- James is overthrown, making his daughter, Mary, & son-in-law, William of Orange, the rulers. They end the Dominion 
	- ![colony demographics| 300 ](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/5fa78a93-cd03-4bc6-9cb4-47818a96eecf/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20230113%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230113T015755Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-Signature=e6173f69a5b553952c1a28ccad2121327dae4f9fc8ba9694779f02d4f078182a&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=filename%3D%22Untitled.png%22&x-id=GetObject)
- #### Colonial culture
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Enlightenment era:</mark> time when European thinkers challenged traditional views by applying scientific method
		- Rational reason understanding #culture 
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">John Locke:</mark> **(1)** <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Tabula Rasa:</mark> essay concerning human understanding: no human is born innately good or sinful, we are a blank slate **(2)**  <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Two Treatises of Government:</mark> people should come together and form a social contract to create a government. Whole purpose of government is to protect <u>lives, liberty and pursuit of property</u> #culture
- #### Great Awakening
	- Rejection of rationalism @ the heart of enlightenment
	- Schism: <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Old Light</mark> (traditional Protestant branches) v. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">New Light Churches</mark> (emotional release into evangelical birth) #culture 
	- Consequences: pluralism (divisions), challenge traditional thought </span>, put emotion over learning, undermine recommended wisdom, dissent from consensus 
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Glorious Revolution:</mark> James II was overthrown b/c he taxed cider without voter knowledge & converted to Catholicism 
	- William & Mary agree to constitutional monarchy, create a bill of rights
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">King William's War:</mark> fought in Europe but also America between French & English → first world war  #conflict 
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Salem Witchcraft Crisis:</mark> reaction to the change happening in the colonies, Puritans believed it was punishment for breaking the covenant. Causes women to be targeted for "witchcraft" #culture

- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Stono Rebellion (1739):</mark> enslaved Africans gathered and went around killing landowners b/c they were made to work on feast day #rebellion 
	- Raises concern about future rebellion, causing more laws to be created against slaves
- #### French & Indian War
	- English need more land to grow crops & support increasingly growing population, so they look to OH. But PA, DE, and Dutch want it. 
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Albany Congress</mark> is called to hopefully ally w/ Iroquois, create Plan of Union to coordinate attacks, and an intercolonial govt.
		- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Plan of Union</mark> says we should have royal governor in addition to intercolonial assembly. This doesn't work
	- Despite having the natives on their side, the French lose & give up all their NA continental holdings to the English, causing them to double their debt. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Treaty of Paris</mark> ends war #Treaty
		- Colonists get secure borders
		- Spain gets NE but loses FL
		- Natives can't play European powers against each other
	- <mark class="hltr-pink">Proclamation Line of 1763</mark>: boundary line drawn along headwaters, marking the British American Colonies. Pisses off all the squatters

## Chapter 2: The Revolutionary Era
- #### Real vs. Virtual Representation
	- Colonists believe their representation is drawn from the constituency it represents: <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">real representation</mark>. They believe parliament can't represent t hem b/c they don't know needs or wants of individual colonies
	- English believe that every member of parliament represents everyone in the empire: <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">virtual representation</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Real Whig ideology:</mark> powerful governments are dangerous, especially ones led by a monarch (republicanism!)
- #### Revenue Acts (+ Currency Act)  
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Sugar act:</mark> reduced pre-existing 6 pence tax on molasses to 3 pence and will strictly enforce it (vice admiralty courts). This act was codified b/c colonists wouldn't pay pre-existing tax and would just bribe the customs officer #colonialTyranny 
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Currency acts:</mark> outlawed colonial issues of paper money #colonialTyranny 
		-    Colonial perspective: believe they could not maintain vigorous economic activity w/o their own currency

	- Stamp act is repealed but <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Declaratory Act</mark> is passed: legal for England to tax the colonies whenever they want #colonialTyranny 
- #### Townshend Acts 
	- Charles Townshend creates a series of acts, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Townshend Acts</mark>, that violate mercantilism (colonies can just buy their own shit) #colonialTyranny 
		1. Tax on items imported from Britain: glass, lead, paper, tea
		2. Parliament pays provincial officials
		3. Open additional vice-admiralty courts
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Daughters of Liberty</mark> formed

- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Tea Act:</mark> passed in response to the East Indies Company going bankrupt, makes the East Indies Company the sole provider of tea to the colonies. Angered colonists b/c they saw it as England trying to monopolize the colonies #colonialTyranny 
	- Results in the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Boston Tea Party:</mark> colonists pretend to be natives and force themselves on a boat, then destroy all the tea in Boston Harbor

	1. Define American Grievances
	2. Develop a plan for resistance
	3. Figure out a constitutional relationship w/ GB
	- Articles of Association/Continental Association

- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Siege of Boston:</mark> British seized Boston but quickly withdrew  #conflict 
- #### British assumptions about war 
	- Patriot forces can't withstand trained British military

	- Capturing major cities will result in the end of the war
	- Military vic roy = political vic roy
- #### Second Continental Congress
	- Called to consider ministry's response to Continental Association
	1. De Facto government → extralegal; not illegal but not protected by law
	2. Printed money, foreign affairs, created a navy, strengthened militia, hired GW
	3. Olive Branch Petition: "if George III knew what was happening, he'd take their side" → NO LOL
	- Government needs legitimacy - Articles of Confederation; Continental Congress - Confederation Congress
- #### Varieties of republicanism
	1. Classical: republics don't work when they're large, virtuous, led by a natural aristocracy of merit. Small republic means more are represented 
	2. Economic: virtue doesn't last long, rational self-interest is inevitable, pursuit of private interests
	3. Egalitarian: govt. needs to respond to the needs of ordinary folk
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Patriots</mark> make up 2/5 of population: local merchants, members of dominant protestant groups, Chesapeake gentry,..

	- Ambassadors Ben Franklin, John Jay & John Adams were told to let France handle the negotiations but France didn't want to end the war, they wanted Gibraltar for Spain
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Articles 4 & 5:</mark> allowed Britain to collect previous debt. Problematic as the federal government can't enforce taxes, only colonies #Treaty 
		- Return loyalist land (this doesn't happen)
- #### Confederation Congress
	- One house, no power to regulate foreign trade, enforce laws, or tax, approval of 9 states required to enact laws, 13 states need to approve amendments to the Articles, no executive branch, no national court system
	- Main focus was foreign affairs, currency & postage system
	- Britain, France, Spain restrict trade for young US w/ Caribbean holdings. Didn't think they could handle their population

- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Revenue Act:</mark> 5% import duty → raise import tax, particularly on England so citizens can buy cheaper domestic goods 
- Madison doesn't think a Bill of Rights is necessary but is forced to do it. Believes in explicit govt. #economy

## Chapter 3: The Early Republic 
- U.S is in awk position due to the French Revolution - need to pick a side
- #### First political party system
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Jay’s Treaty</mark>: U.S is pissed at England because they: **(1)** haven’t withdrawn from the Great Lakes (violating article 4), **(2)** didn’t pay for the slaves they liberated, **(3)** seizing American vessels & cargo, **(4)** impressing American sailors (forcing them into the British navy) → “once a British subject, always a British subject”. John Jay becomes Ambassador for England, creates treaty: #Treaty 
		1. England withdraws from Great Lakes 
		2. Pay for depreciations against American shipping
		3. Create tributary that England won't attack U.S ships, still doesn't stop the harassment; U.S not reimbursed for cost of runaway slaves 
		4. Grant U.S trading privileges in UK
	- Leads to: **(1)** tensions w/ France **(2)** completely partisan vote → all federalists vote for it, no Democrats vote for it **(3)** War of 1812
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Pickney Treaty:</mark> treaty giving states permission to trade through the Mississippi River → "if you won't vote for Jay's Treaty, you can't vote for Pickney treaty" #Treaty

- #### Foreign affairs 
	- 🇫‍🇷 fucks w/ 🇺‍🇸 and seizes their ships. U.S ambassador comes to France but is refused #foreignAffairs 
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">XYZ Affair:</mark> 3 US diplomats meet 3 French diplomats, who immediately ask for a bribe. This pisses off the 🇺‍🇸 → nickname the French diplomats "agent x/y/z" #foreignAffairs
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Quasi War</mark> between America & France ensued. Not much conflict, just a series of naval battles in the Caribbean → France loses  #conflict

- <mark class="hltr-pink">Inside/outside societal structure:</mark> men did all the outdoor work (fields, herding, firewood, fishing, hunting); women did the “inside” work (gardens, milking, chickens, spinning, weaving, preserving food, meals, cloth, childcare)
- When the means of production leave the home, the traditional workers leave with it. Women go to weave, men go to factories
- Factories used a “<mark class="hltr-pink">outwork system</mark>” for women → owners give the women cloth before they leave & if they come the next day with clothes ready, they get $

	    - Men: public sphere, provide and protect families. Men responsible for capitalism, public life, cyclical economy
	    - Women: private/domestic sphere, moral compass and guardians, nurtured and guarded the family’s morality. Women are responsible for the country’s morals, the home, raise & educate children
    - Home moves from being a **center of production** →  **center of consumption** →  results in shrinking families but childhood becomes longer (as it becomes separated from production; avg. age of marriage was pushed back
    - *Previously*: republican motherhood, politicized women’s traditional roles → *Now*: resubmerge women in the home, women raise the next generation of virtuous citizens

	    - <mark class="hltr-pink">Webster Hayne Debate</mark>: Hayne (represents Calhoun) argues for immediate access to western land so that slavery can expand, Webster disagrees. Becomes a debate of slavery → Webster wins
	        - South claims that the North can’t regulate slavery, says they can nullify laws if they want
	    - <mark class="hltr-pink">Tariff of Abominations (1828):</mark> sought to protect northern and western agricultural products from competition with foreign imports but NC doesn’t argue against it because they hope Jackson will reverse it #foreignAffairs 
	        - <mark class="hltr-pink">Tariff of 1832</mark>: set to reverse some of the effects of the Tariff of Abominations so NC nullifies both tariffs #foreignAffairs 
	        - Jackson to pass a <mark class="hltr-pink">Force act</mark>, which would force SC to pay using the military. Causes Calhoun to resign his role as VP & join senate

	- Charter to expire in 1836: recharter early to embarrass Andrew Jackson, who doesn’t want a bank → plan backfires on Clay, Andrew Jackson vetoes the recharter & the public supports him
	    - BUS notes circulated as national currency & could be redeemed for gold and silver. Bank acted as a clearing house for state banks, refusing to accept bank notes of any local bank that lacked sufficient gold reserves
	- <mark class="hltr-pink">Pet Banks</mark>: one bank in each state to be the depository of federal funds #economy 
	- <mark class="hltr-pink">Deposit Act of 1836</mark>: provided for the distribution of the federal surplus to the states in proportion to their population. You have to pay with gold & silver

- #### Indian Removal
	- U.S was initially accommodating to the natives
	- In GA, there was an area belonging to Cherokees that they don't wanna give up (there's gold). Cherokee has a rule saying they don't have to sell their land but govt. makes them 
	- <mark class="hltr-pink">Indian Removal Act:</mark> federal funds for relocations (3/5 clause gave South power in the government)
- #### Cherokees & Marshall's court
	- <mark class="hltr-pink">Cherokee Nation vs Georgia (1831):</mark> Backed by sympathetic whites but not by President Andrew Jackson, the Cherokees under Chief John Ross turned to the federal courts to defend their treaty with the United States #law 
	- Neither a foreign nation nor a state, but Cherokee have a right to their lands
	- <mark class="hltr-pink">Worchester v. Georgia</mark>: Marshall defined the Cherokee position more clearly. The Cherokee nation was a distinct political community in which “the laws of Georgia can have no force” and into which Georgians could not enter without permission or treaty privilege #law

	- Mechanization: sowers, reapers, iron, steel plows 
- Women send out all kinds of reformatory pamphlets via the mailing system (Andrew Jackson does not like this - bars them from using the USPS)
- <mark class="hltr-pink">American and Foreign Antislavery Society</mark>: women removed from the movement, methodology of making changes within politics power
- William Lloyd Garrison & The Liberator created the <mark class="hltr-pink">American Anti-Slavery Society</mark> → controlled by women but inherently racist, use moral suasion to convince slaves to stop
- #### Democrats v. Whigs
	- In the 1830s, remnants of the National Republicans & Anti-Mason parties come together to become the Whigs
	- Whigs pushed for industrial & commercial development within the nation's current borders. #politicalParty 
		- Vision of economic expansion demanded an activist govt., while Democrats reaffirmed the Jeffersonian principle of limited government. Also supported corporate charters, a natl. bank & paper currency. 
| Democrats | Whigs |
| --- | --- |
| Pro agriculture | Suspicious of rapid westward expansion |
| More power to the states/people, less to the federal govt. | Interested in: industrial and commercial development |
| Strict interpretation of the constitution | Activist government |
| More likely to defend slavery | Corporate charters, a national bank, paper currency |
| “heirs of Jefferson” | Progress & perfectibility |
| In beginning, draw support from South & North, then eventually exclusively the South | Public schools, prison and asylums, temperance |
| See importance of the West, committed to Indian removal | Government can help special interests if it promotes general welfare |
| Against Congress creating corporate charters, a national bank & paper currency | Worry about “excesses of democracy” and preferred to see society ruled from top down |
| Against government involvement in moral & social reform → “government that governs the best, governs the least” | Evangelical protestants |
| “Equal rights” … sovereignty of the “people” | Coalition: AA New Englanders and well-settled slave owners in the Upper South |
| Coalition: nonevangelical Protestants, Catholics, Mormons, yeoman fa, wage earnings, frontier slave owners & immigrants |  |
 
- It is the country’s [[AP US History/Semester 1 Midterm (APUSH)#^13767f \|manifest destiny]] to expand the cotton → the term is coined 
- USA is invited by Mexico to move into Texas, maintain duel citizenship. Mexico **(1)** allows them to use slavery, ****(2)**** can self-govern themselves. #foreignAffairs 
    - US citizens want autonomy, so they revolt against the Mexican government & became independent → USA won’t annex it because no one wants to be on record supporting the expansion of slavery in the region
    - Polk runs for president, promises to buy California, take all of Oregon and a bit more, then annex Canada. If he gets the presidency, he’ll complete all these things, then won’t run for re-election as long as he gets everything he wants
- Polk gets Oregon (Oregon Treaty), then annexes Texas, then Mexico finally sells California to the USA #foreignAffairs 
    - Polk provokes a war against Mexico, causing America to invade Mexico, where they take Mexico city
- #### Mexican War: 1846 - 1848
	- <mark class="hltr-pink">Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</mark>: US gains CA, NM, present day NV, UT, AZ, parts of CO and WY #Treaty 
	- US paid claims to US citizens of $3.2 million (U.S citizens in Texas who have claims against Mexico for property damage), $15 million to Mexico
	- <mark class="hltr-pink">Slave power conspiracy</mark>: North believes this is evidence that slave powers in the South hold too much power in the government → in congress, judicial, executive. Concentration of slave power interest is what leads to the Mexican War
	    - <mark class="hltr-pink">Wilmot Proviso</mark>: never passed, states that slavery cannot be allowed in any territory gained from the Mexican War. Whigs wanted to pass this b/c they know it wouldn’t pass, proving that the Mexican American War was a slave power conspiracy
- Territories don't extend Missouri Compromise line
- <mark class="hltr-pink">Calhoun's State Sovereignty:</mark> says that individuals in each of the states have the right to use the territories equally (open to all American citizens) → if a Michigander can move to California and bring their belongings with him (property), then a South Carolinian can do the same, with their property INCLUDING their slaves
- <mark class="hltr-pink">Free Soil Party</mark> (not abolitionist): wage labor, no slave labor but they’re not abolitionist #politicalParty 
- <mark class="hltr-blue">Lewis Cass</mark>: MI state governor, uses idea of Popular Sovereignty → people in territories can vote whether they want slavery or want
    - <mark class="hltr-pink">Charm of ambiguity</mark>: states that a territory’s population cannot vote until it becomes a formal state
        - South want this b/c they want slavery to be established first
        - North wants the vote at any time the territory has a population large enough to have a territorial assembly
- <mark class="hltr-pink">Gold Rush</mark>: young men setting off to CA to get gold, means that law and order needs to be implemented 
- #### Compromise of 1850
	- Slave trade abolished in Washington D.C
	- Texas boundary set, Texas gets $10 million for territory lost to NM territory
	- NM and Utah territories established by popular sovereignty
	- [[AP US History/Notion/Chapter 12 - Politics and Fate of the Union, 1812-1859#^d099fa \|Fugitive Slave Act]] strengthened (North responds w/ personal liberty laws), gave additional powers to slave owners to recapture slaves and angered northerners b requiring their complicity
	    - Citizens can be deputized to join a search party for a runaway slave
	    - $10 if a U.S marshal returns a fugitive to the South
	    - There’s no requirement for a fugitive’s appearance, so free men from the North were being taken to the South to become slaves, even though they were born free
{ #e765e6}

	- Slave TRADE illegal in D.C
- In the South, the disintegration of the Whig Party had left many southerners at loose ends politically. The security of their own communities seemed at stake, and in the 1850s, most formerly Whig slaveholders converted to the Democratic Party
- ### Kansas Nebraska Act
	- Compromised compromises → nation at this point has relied on the Missouri Compromise, however Nebraska and Kansas were slave states
	- <mark class="hltr-blue">Stephen Douglas</mark> - Illinois Senator, wants to create a transcontinental railroad with a terminus in Chicago, has to gain southern support
	    - Terminus in Chicago would anger the Southerners significantly, plus the RR would have to lay through Kansas, which isn’t settled
	    - <mark class="hltr-pink">Kansas Nebraska Act</mark>: Douglas overturns the Missouri Compromise, making the South happy, who then approve the building of the RR
{ #37fcac}

	    - Douglas gets rid of the [[AP US History/Semester 1 Midterm (APUSH)#^86bca6 \|Missouri Compromise ]]because Kansas & Nebraska territory wasn’t settled & it didn’t have a climate susceptible for slave-produced crops
	- <mark class="hltr-pink">Border Ruffians</mark> (pro-slavery forces) cross over to Kansas to vote → Kansas and Nebraska slave stance is to be settled by popular sovereignty
- Consequences of the Kansas Nebraska Act: **(1)** end of the second party system/beginning of the third **(2)** Whig party falls apart - Northern & Southern Whigs can't work together
{ #d5064e}

- <mark class="hltr-pink">Know Nothings</mark>: anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant party whose influence peaked in the mid-1850s #politicalParty 
- The [[AP US History/Semester 1 Midterm (APUSH)#^d5064e \|Kansas Nebraska Act]] spawned hatred and violence as land-hungry partisans in the sectional struggle clashed repeatedly in Kansas Territory. Abolitionists and religious groups sent in armed Free-Soil settlers; southerners sent in their reinforcements to establish slavery and prevent “northern hordes” from stealing Kansas
- In May, a proslavery posse sent to arrest the Free-Soil leaders sacked Kansas town of Lawrence, killing several people and destroying a hotel with a cannon.
- These passions brought violence to the U.S. Senate in May 1856, when <mark class="hltr-pink">Charles Sumner</mark> denounced “the Crime against Kansas” → Since he was radical in his anti-slavery views he got beat by a cane by Representative Preston Brooks
- #### Republican Party
	- Antislavery Whigs & Democrats, Free-Soilers, and other reformers throughout the old NW met to form the Republican party, a coalition dedicated to keeping slavery out of the territories #politicalParty 
	- ![[Party systems.canvas]]
- #### Dred Scott Case
	- <mark class="hltr-blue">Dred Scott</mark> and his wife, <mark class="hltr-blue">Harriet Robinson Scott</mark>, sued for their freedom based on their former owner taking them for several years into Illinois, a free state, and to Fort Snelling in the Missouri Compromise. SC created multiple precedents w/ this case: #law 
		1. Scott not a citizen of the US or MO
		2. Residence in a free state does not make you free
		3. Congress has no power to bar slavery from any territory 
		4. African Americans have “no rights which the white man was bound to respect” 
- <mark class="hltr-pink">John Brown’s Raid</mark>: an unsuccessful attempt to start a slave revolution on the federal arsenal @ Harper’s Ferry. It resulted in the death of 10 people, including two of Brown's sons, and Brown himself was later hanged for treason #rebellion 
## Chapter 5: The Civil War & Reconstruction
- SC is first state to secede and many states follow: 
	![[Pasted image 20230115214819.png \| 500]]
* Lincoln sought only to hold onto forts in the states that had left the Union, reasoning that in this way he could assert federal sovereignty while waiting for a restoration.
* <mark class="hltr-blue">George B. McClellan:</mark> Union general very popular with troops who proved better at organization and training at fighting
* <mark class="hltr-pink">Anaconda plan</mark>: called for a blockade of southern ports and eventual capture of the Missouri River → “strangle” the Confederacy  #conflict 
* <mark class="hltr-blue">Ulysses S. Grant:</mark> Union general who, in 1864, became Commanding General of the United States army
* <mark class="hltr-blue">Robert E. Lee:</mark> Confederate general who, in 1862, commanded the Army of Northern Virginia. In 1865 he became the general-in-chief of the Confederate army
* Davis desperately wanted European nations to recognize the Confederacy
* #### Battles of the Civil War 
	* <mark class="hltr-red">Fort Sumter:</mark> Federal fort in Charleston harbor, South Carolina where the first shots of the Civil War were fired when the Union attempted to resupply troops  #conflict
	* <mark class="hltr-red">Battle of Bull Run:</mark> first major land battle of the civil war. Half a million southerners volunteered to fight  #conflict 
	* <mark class="hltr-red">Battle of Shiloh:</mark> The bloodiest battle in American history to that date, and it happened in southern Tennessee  #conflict 
	* <mark class="hltr-red">Battle of Antietam:</mark> First major battle on northern soil. McClellan moved slowly, failed to use his larger forces in simultaneous attacks, and allowed Lee’s stricken army to retreat to safety across the Potomac  #conflict 
	* <mark class="hltr-red">Battle of Chancellorsville:</mark> decisive Confederate victory in the American Civil War, where Robert E. Lee and his army defeated the larger Union forces of Joseph Hooker.  #conflict 
	* <mark class="hltr-red">Battle of Vicksburg: </mark> Union vic roy that gave the North complete control of the Mississippi  #conflict 
		* If Vicksburg fell, Union forces would control the river, cutting the Confederacy in 2 and gaining an open path → interior 
	* <mark class="hltr-red">Battle of Gettysburg:</mark> Union victory that halted the Confederate invasion of Pennsylvania; turning point in the war in the East  #conflict 
		* Vicksburg & Gettysburg (both intense battles w/ high casualty rates) forced General Kirby Smith to operate on his own

	* Its leaders called for an end to the war and reunion on the basis of “the Constitution as it is and the Union as it was
- #### War transforms the South
	- One of the first traditions to fall was the southern preference for local and limited government. States’ rights had been a formative ideology for the Confederacy, but state governments were weak operations → Creation of a large govt. bureaucracy (<mark class="hltr-pink">government girls</mark>) 
	* Faced with a critical shortage of troops, in April 1862 the Confederate government enacted the first national conscription (draft) law in American history. Thus, the war forced unprecedented change on states that had seceded out of fear of change
	    * <mark class="hltr-pink">Confederate Draft</mark> - As their fortunes declined, people of once-modest means looked around and found abundant evidence that all classes were not sacrificing equally. The Confederate government enacted policies that decidedly favored the upper class. 
	    * Until the last year of war, for example, prosperous southerners could avoid military service by hiring substitutes.
	* Davis adopted a firm leadership role toward the Confederate Congress, which raised taxes and later passed a tax-in-kind - paid in farm products. 
	* Davis further exhorted state governments to require farmers to switch from cash crops to food crops. But the army remained short of food and labor #economy 
	* The wives and mothers of soldiers now headed households and performed men’s work, including raising crops and tending animals. #economy #culture 
	- All arms, supplies & troops under national command
	- Suspended writ of habeas corpus (prevents individuals from being held w/o a trial

	- Seize control of railroads
	- Inequities and the “<mark class="hltr-pink">20 Negro Law</mark>”: if someone eligible for the draft has 20+ slaves, they're exempt from the Draft
- #### Northern economy
	- The North will win the war in large part because it is more fully industrialized than the South, but the Civil War will also push the North into a full industrial revolution
	- Treasury, new national banking system w/ national bank notes, greenbacks, income tax
	- Furthered agricultural revolution as machines replace missing workers
	- <mark class="hltr-pink">Quartermaster Dept</mark>.: Montgomery Meigs. Ex: Jay Cooke & govt. bonds
	    - Meigs invested a lot of money into the Union army, equipping soldiers lavishly
	- <mark class="hltr-pink">Transcontinental RR</mark> and govt. subsidies
	    - U.S invested money into the railroad companies
	- <mark class="hltr-pink">Morrill Land Grant Act</mark>: set aside federal lands for states to create colleges to “benefit the agricultural and mechanical art”
	- <mark class="hltr-pink">Homestead Act</mark>: gave 160 acres of land to whoever would farm the land for 5 years and improve it
	- <mark class="hltr-pink">U.S. Sanitary Commission:</mark> Civilian organization in the North, staffed by large numbers of women, that was a major source of medical and nutritional aid for soldiers 
- While Lincoln was running for president, he said he’ll do whatever it take to unite the union → ban slavery in the South
- As time went on, Lincoln became significantly more opposed to slavery
	- Against slavery but believes that blacks and whites shouldn't live together → colonization in Liberia
- <mark class="hltr-pink">First Confiscation Act:</mark> confiscated all property used for insurrectionary purposes; mandated that if the South used slaves in their war effort,
- <mark class="hltr-pink">Second Confiscation Act</mark>: confiscated property of **anyone who** ********************supported******************** the war; freed all slaves held by the South
- Gradual emancipation w/ compensation for slave owners & colonization
- <mark class="hltr-pink">Radical Republicans:</mark> #politicalParty group of Republicans who assailed President Lincoln early in the war for failing to make emancipation a war goal and, later, for making it too easy for defeated rebel states to return to the Union
{ #768e47}

- #### Emancipation Proclamation
	- After the Battle of Antietam, Lincoln declares “all persons held as slaves in areas in rebellion shall be then, thenceforward and forever free
	    - But … not the border states and not any country or city under Union control
	- Makes the Northern Army an army of liberation → whatever areas the Union controls, all slaves are forever free & abolishes slavery
	- Lincoln based this on his powers of Commander in Chief, so it could expire after his term → must amend the constitution!! 
	- When Lincoln wins re-election in 1864 (largely b/c he lets soldiers vote), he forces Congress to create an amendment abolishing slavery → 13th Amendment
- Both Lincoln & the slaves themselves are accredited with freeing the slaves; **(1)** Lincoln: Emancipation proclamation & 13th Amendment, **(2)** slaves: if the slaves didn't free themselves throughout the south, the confiscation acts wouldn't've been necessary
* #### Presidential (Lincoln) v. congressional reconstruction

	4. <mark class="hltr-pink">Wade-Davis Manifesto</mark> (congressional): manifesto written by Radical Republicans urging voters to not vote for their candidate, Lincoln
- <mark class="hltr-pink">13th Amendment:</mark> Ratified in December 1865, it permanently abolished slavery in all U.S. territories → ratified BEFORE Lincoln's second term
	* The proposed amendment passed in early 1865 and was sent to the states for ratification. The war to save the Union had also become the war to free the slaves
* <mark class="hltr-pink">Freedman's Bureau:</mark> supplied food and medical services, built several thousand schools and some colleges, negotiated several hundred thousand employment contracts, tried to manage confiscated land
* Congress tells Southern states that **if they want help from the government, they must ratify the 13th amendment** (2/3 of congress votes the amendment out and 2/3 of the states must ratify) #reconstruction 
* Lincoln is shot in April of 1865 & his VP, Andrew Johnson, takes power
* <mark class="hltr-pink">Sherman’s Special Field Order Number 15</mark>: 400,000 acres in Sea Islands region… Johnson overturns it #reconstruction

		- Only those who took the <mark class="hltr-pink">Oath of Amnesty</mark> were eligible to vote on rejoining the Union
	2. Congress demands extension of Freedman's Bureau, passes <mark class="hltr-pink">Civil Rights Act of 1866</mark> → granted African Americans citizenship rights, including the right to own property and sue in court, thus protecting them from discrimination.
	3. Johnson vetoes the Civil Rights Act of 1866
	4. Congress overwrites the veto
	5. <mark class="hltr-pink">Black codes</mark> (presidential): used the slave codes as a basis to regulate the behavior of freedmen
	6. <mark class="hltr-pink">14th Amendment</mark>(congressional): federal government protects rights and liberties of citizens from state tyranny → shift from idea of "federal tyranny" → "state tyranny"
