### Reconstruction
- Important questions
    1. Who should rule in the South (the traditional ruling elite who committed treason by seceding?)
    2. Who should rule in the federal government (how to rebalance power after the massive expansion of the executive branch under Lincoln)
        - After Lincoln expanded the executive Branch, the government wanted to return power to congress
    3. What rights should freedmen have?
        - Radical republicans say its all of them
    4. What will Reconstruction be at its essence? A second revolution?
- Jackson is elected but quickly impeached, returning power back to congress. Johnson takes over b/c congress is adjourned for months

| Presidential Reconstruction Act                                                                                                                                                                                    | Congressional Reconstruction: Re-Act; Radical Republicans                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| (1) Lincoln’s 10% plan: 10% of a state’s population must pledge loyalty to the federal government. Louisiana, Tennessee & Arkansas join the Union w/ the 10% rule. Federal government & constitution, end slavery. | (2) Wade-Davis Bill: (1) majority of white male citizens must participate in creating a new government; (2) 50% of the population must sign an ironclad oath stating they never supported the confederacy; (3) high Confederate officials are stripped of citizenship |
| (3) Lincoln pocket vetoes the Wade-Davis Bill; he doesn’t do anything about it and lets it expire                                                                                                                  | (4) Wade-Davis Manifesto: manifesto written by Radical Republicans urging voters to not vote for their candidate, Lincoln,                                                                                                                                            |
##### 13th Amendment & Freedman’s Bureau                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
- Problems w/ Emancipation Proclamation. 1864 Republican platform
- 13th Amendment
	- Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.
	- Section 2. Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation → complete change in government. Before: tyranny comes from non-local government. Now: the federal government looks out for tyranny, creates a safety net
- Freedman’s Bureau: supplied food and medical services, built several thousand schools and some colleges, negotiated several hundred thousand employment contracts, tried to manage confiscated land
- Congress tells Southern states that if they want help from the government, they must ratify the 13th amendment (2/3 of congress votes the amendment out and 2/3 of the states must ratify
- Emancipation Proclamation was created as executive order, so it could end at end of war, therefore the 13th amendment is necessary
##### 40 Acres and a Mule
- Sherman’s Special Field Order Number 15: 400,000 acres in Sea Islands region… Johnson overturns it
- Instead, sharecropping begins: tenants live on land that the landlord rents them, incl land, tools & feed, exchange for half of their crops
##### Presidential v. Congressional Reconstruction 
| Presidential Reconstruction Act, Andrew Johnson| Congressional Reconstruction, Radical Republicans  |
| --- | --- |
| “The Constitution as it is, and the Union as it was” | Adjourned until 1865 |
| (1) Johnson reconstruction plan:                                                                                                          1) Barred from citizenship: federal officials, high-ranking Confederate officers, political leaders & graduates of West Point of Annapolis who joined the Confederacy. Ex-Confederates whose taxable property was worth more than $20,000                                                                             2) Ratify the 13th amendment                                                                                                         3) Write a new Constitution, must outlaw secession                                                                         4) Only those taken the oath of amnesty and eligible to vote on the day the state seceded could participate in state constitutional conventions                                                                                  -Johnson does this all while Congress was adjourned  | (2)Demand extension of Freedman’s Bureau and passage of Civil Rights Act of 1866 |
| (3) Johnson vetoes the Civil Rights Act of 1866 | (4) Congress overrides the veto |
| (5) Black codes: used the slave codes as a basis to regulate the behavior of freedmen | (6) 14th Amendment: federal government protects rights and liberties of citizens from state tyranny → “no state can make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of the U.S…nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. Greatest danger to liberty are the states  |
| (7) “Swing Around the Circle” - Johnson tried to get democrats in Congress to work on reconstruction but the Radical Republicans stayed in congress | (8) (Military) Reconstruction Act of 1867: creates five military generals with small(ish) troops garrisoning to enforce fair election. |
| (9)Continued Intransigence - Johnson continues to obstruct the work of congress  | (10) 2nd, 3rd, 4th reconstruction Acts; Tenure of Office: prohibited the president from removing a member of the cabinet without seeking approval from congress  |
| Lame duck: a politician who loses their power |  |
##### Reconstruction Acts
- ==First Reconstruction Act== : Union generals, commanding garrisons of troops and charged with supervising elections, assumed control in five military districts in the South. Confederate leaders were barred from voting until new constitutions were ratified.  
	- Guaranteed freedmen the right to vote in elections as well as serve in state constitutional conventions and in subsequent elections
- ==The Second, Third, and Fourth Reconstruction Acts:==  provided the details of operation for voter registration boards, the adoption of constitutions, and the administration of “good faith” oaths on the part of white southerners 
- After Johnson tried to remove Stanton ([[#^688b4e  |Tenure of Office]]), he was at last successfully impeached (on the third time) → remained in office w/ less than a year left in his term
- ==Fifteenth Amendment:==  Prohibited states from denying the vote to any citizen on account of “race, color or previous condition of servitude”
  - Final measure in the constitutional revolution of Reconstruction
### The West
##### U.S Indian policy in the west
 - The "west" and the "frontier" have changing definitions → the U.S has a "rolling" frontier and the "west" is defined by where the "east" is currently located. tl;dr: frontier is frequently changing
- Native populations in the west - lifestyle vary by ecology of the region 
	- Crop growing (prairie regions)
	- Livestock raising 
	- Hunting/fishing/gathering
	- Trading & raiding
- Big factors: slaughter of the buffalo, decline of salmon, "too much testosterone" and government policies & treaties 
- What changes in the west?
	- White men with lots of testosterone who come west in search of the gold rush or the [[#^0b9b31 |Homestead Act]]
	- Loss of wildlife (salmon, buffalo)
##### U.S government policy
- ==Reservation policy:== US govt. forces multiple (possibly warring) tribes on the same reservations, then didn't respect the treaties . Is active until the 1880's until the govt. takes an assimilation stance
%%(continuation of policies that led to Indian Removal in the 1880s)%%
- Portion of former lands, with promised protection from white encroachment, and agreements to provide food, clothing and other necessities 
- Movement into market economy increased many tribes' dependence on federal government subsidies 
> [!info] Problems
> - Ward status (like children) - defined the Natives as helpless children under the protection of the U.S government
> 	- Denied U.S citizenship
> 	- No 14th/15th amendment protection
> 	- White settlers continued to encroach on Native lands no matter what the treaty agreement or reservation boundaries said; ignored Native history by putting warring tribes on the same land 
> 

![[Pasted image 20230124120336.png|500]]

##### Resistance & Indian Wars
- Navajo, "Long Walk" (1863-64, much like the [[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^5ae16c|trail of tears]])
- ==Sand Creek Massacre== of Cheyenne band by Major John Chivington (1864): a group of soldiers gets drunk then kill an entire tribe while they were PEACEFULLY transitioning to a new reservation (?) UNDER TREATY → goes to congress 
- Pinnacle of resistance: ==Little Big Horn== → Lakota Cheyenne destroyed the U.S military and there were no white settlers left alive. Most successful Indian rebellion → marks the end of native resistance
- ==The Ghost Dance== was a reaction to U.S colonialism and it entailed dancing for hours in order to communicate with elders & negotiate for a future that respected their belief. 
- Ghost Dance begins a conflict b/c some natives tell whites that their dance outfits are bulletproof, initiating ==Wounded Knee==
- Reform
- ==Women's National Indian Association==: white women bring literacy, western civilization to native societies in attempts to bring reform. They find problem w/ Native society's work balance → women's role is more substantial in native society than separate sphere society   ^fe3a2e
- ==Indian Rights Association:== groups that believe Natives have a right to citizenship and landholding 
- Emphasis on European sexual division of labor (native women lose traditional role) 
##### Dawes Severalty Act
- Supported by the [[#^fe3a2e|Women's National Indian Association]] 
- Ends reservation policy
- Logical extension of reform, seeks to assimilate Native Americans by emphasizing private land ownership and western family structures
- Family head of household receives 160 acres, each child under 18 gets 40 acres 
	- Land held in trust for 45 years. Citizenship to Native Americans who take the allotment
- Unallocated lands could be sold to whites (SCAMMERS!)
- Case study of the Ojibwas: 138 million acres (1887) → 52 million (1930)
- ==Carlisle school:== most infamous native assimilation school 
##### How the West was won (government/big business cooperation)
- Mining - Nevada, Montana, Utah, Colorado
- Miners prospected, but major corporations mined deposits using modern technologies
	- Example: Anaconda Copper Company (gold, copper, lead, zinc, tin, quartz)
- Lumber corporations - ==Timer and Stone Act:== land deemed unfit for cultivation was sold to settlers for logging + valuable metals
- Oil corporations
- Cattle ranching
- ==Central & Union Pacific:== massive land subsidies and other incentives (180 million acres) from federal, state, local govt. 
##### Water 
- ==Riparian Rights==: only those who owned land along a river bank could appropriate from the water's flow. The stream itself belonged to God, those who live near water can take from it but not diminish its flow; largely practiced in the East. "Common law" like [[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^c325c6|Coverture]]
- ==Prior Appropriation:== awarded a river's water to the first person who claimed it - water existed to serve human needs and advance profits (LMFAO WHAT). 
- ==California Solution:== mixed legal system that allowed farmers to organize into districts to construct and operate irrigation projects that could purchase water rights, seize private property, and build irrigation canals → pay for it all via taxation or issuing bonds 
- ==Newlands Reclamation Act:== authorized the Secretary of the Interior to designate irrigation sites and to establish a reclamation fund from the sale of public lands to finance the projects (federal)
##### New states
- ==Omnibus Bill of 1889:== ND, SD, WA, MT
- 1890 - WY & ID (allowed women to vote!)
- 1896 - Utah (should've been earlier)
![[Pasted image 20230127121427.png|500]]

##### Farming the plains
- ==28 inch rainfall line== - West of this line agriculture is very difficult w/o modern irrigation
![[Pasted image 20230130124213.png|500]]
- 1870s - 1880s: more acres put under cultivation in Kansas, Nebraska, and Texas than the entire nation in 250 years
- Insufficient lumber - sod houses, buffalo dung, and barbed wire 
- Unpredictable weather - ==The Children's Blizzard== (1888)
- Social isolation b/c of the war Americans farm
- John Glidden created barbed wire → changed future of fences & property lines
- Mail order companies - Sears & rural free delivery
- Over-farming of the plains occurs thanks to [[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^17ae97|Homestead Act]] & other related acts
- Sears saved a lot of families during first year of homesteading. Amazon:Covid = Sears:Fronteir 
- ==Morril Land Grant Acts (1862/1890):== set aside federal lands to create colleges to “benefit the agricultural and mechanical arts.” 
- ==Hatch Act:== provided for necessary basic and applied agricultural research to be conducted by the state colleges of agriculture in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
- ==Dry Farming:== crop production without irrigation during a dry season 
- ==Russian wheat:== wheat that grows easily on the plains, brought from Russia
- Luther Burbank & George Washington Carver were horticulturists who researched crops that grow easily on the plain - Carver created the peanut 
- Vaqueros - Open-range ranching 
- ==Fence Cutter wars:== series of disputes between cowboys w/ larger land holdings   
- 21 year era of the cowboy was put to an end by the use of barbed wire 
##### "New" South?
- Henry Grady, editor, *Atlanta Constitution*
- Mixed industry and Commercial Agriculture - infrastructure to tie together the South & North. Not a total focus on industrialism in the South though ⇒ **doesn't work**
- Industry in the South: textile mills, cigarette (Duke buys patent for a cigarette rolling machine), lumber, iron/steel, Coca-Cola, coal mining - railroads 
- Agriculture - share cropping, tenant farming, crop lien
	- $\frac{1}{3}$ of farmers were sharecroppers @ 1880
	- $\frac{2}{3}$ of farmers were sharecroppers @ 1920
- Closing the Southern range
- Continued racism limited economic advancement 
%%Evaluate the extent to which the US expansion into the West had a lasting legacy on the nation and the region.%%
%%Evaluate the extent to which the homesteading act changed the economic, political, and social landscape of the US West.%%
##### Patricia Limerick, "The Legacy of Conquest"
<iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" style="border:0px" src="https://books.google.com/books?id=Kk1PMykiIE4C&lpg=PT338&ots=MBCxFg35gm&dq=%22In%201871%20an%20informal%20army%20of%20Arizona%20civilians%20descended%22&pg=PT338&output=embed" width=500 height=500></iframe>

- Thesis: racism complicated the west, foreshadowing the challenges the U.S will face with diversity in the 2nd century
- Social unrest is occurring @ the same time in China 
	- Push: railroad
	- Pull: home 
- *==People v. Hall:==*  involved an attempted murder charge against the defendant, Jonathan Hall. Hall was accused of shooting at two people, striking one in the arm. He was convicted and sentenced to fifteen years in prison. Whether Chinese can testify against whites, blanks, Indians ⇒ SC rules that "if Indians are banned, then Asians should be as well". Prohibits the testimony on the basis that the groups should have been put together (?)
- =="The Chinese Must Go" Movement:== w/ new wave of immigrants, Irish are now "apart" of U.S culture
	- Led in San Francisco by Irish immigrant
- ==Chinese Exclusionary Laws== (1882): federal law stopping almost all immigration from China → US ^600dcd
	- Expires in 20 years, continued until 1940
- ==Anti-Miscegenation Laws:== laws banning interracial sexual relations; passed primarily to prevent Chinese men from marrying white women
##### Exodusters: African Americans in the West
- ==Exodusters:== African Americans who move to the west (post-Civil War) & even form their own all-black towns
	- Very few African Americans leave the South after the civil war ⇒ attempt to stay in place & rebuild family after  they're freed
- [[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^32abaf|Free soil]]
- ==Exclusion laws:== laws banning blacks from certain towns in the West 
	- ==Sundown towns:== all-white municipalities that practice racial segregation by excluding non-whites via some combination of discriminatory local laws, intimidation or violence ⇒ **if any blacks are caught out & about after sundown, they're lynched** (?)
- 14th & 15th Amendments in CA and OR: both states finally ratify the 14th/15th Amendments
##### Mormons in the West
- [[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^e1bd7e|Second Great Awakening]], Joseph Smith, & the *Book of Mormon*
### The Gilded Age
##### Key factors in the industrial revolution
- **Technology & innovation**: electric power, power generator, internal combustion
- **Mechanization, structure of work, economies of scale**: dis-assembly lines (meat packing led the day) → assembly lines via Henry Ford 
- **Business structures/corporate organization**
	- ==Pool:== gentlemen's agreement in which business owners agree not to raise prices. Illegal now
	- ==Trusts:== business owned by one person, but is broken up into stock & given to a board of trustees 
	- ==Cartel:== association of business owners who work together to coordinate prices/production
	- ==Incorporation:== a company recognized by law to exist independently from its owners, with the ability to own property, borrow money, sue or be sued. Encourages funding new business organization 
- ==Consumer republic:== a new national culture 
##### Democratization of convenience 
- Edison - tungsten filament/incandescent light bulb. AC/DC and power generators, also phonograph and motion pictures 
	- Didn't invent lightbulbs but was the first person to make it affordable  
- Henry Ford - democratized the automobile → moving assembly line $5/day ^e2d946
- Andrew Carnegie - Bessemer process and steel production
- DuPonts - gunpowder monopoly → diversified into fertilizer, dyes, cellulose, other chemical products
- Duke, Kellogg, Post 
##### New corporate organization
- New technologies required large capital investments, investment banking entered a new age 
- Holding companies are companies that get bought out, but the goods are still produced under the original company's name → example: Pepsi owning multiple different drink brands 
- ==Horizontal integration:== owning all of one SPECIFIC part of production
- ==Vertical integration:== companies own every step in production. Ex: Ford owning coal mines, transportation from coal → plant, etc
##### Dissent? To capitalism?
- ==Social Darwinism== - Herbert Spencer: the people that have wealth b/c they're better ⇒ trusts shouldn't be destroyed. Wealth flows to those most capable of handling it  
	- Edward Bellamy rejects this notion in *Looking Backward*, stating the **government owns the means of production**. Sets up an alternate economic world where capitalism is restrained. Everyone works according to their abilities 
- ==Sherman Antitrust Act== (1890): Prohibits "every contract, combination, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states." Makes it illegal for individuals or companies to "monopolize"  ^1a2e5c
- ==*U.S v. E.C Knight Co*== (1895): sugar trust owned 98% of sugar-refining but court ruled that control of manufacturing doesn't equal control of trade ⇒ discarded much of the Sherman Antitrust Act
##### Changing nature and status of labor
- ==Scientific Management/Fredrick Taylor== ("Taylorism"): scientific organization of production by subdividing tasks to increase efficiency ⇒ make jobs increasingly skill-less 
- Workers increasingly powerless, become the interchangeable parts themselves 
	- Ex: McCormick Reapers - had been hand made by skilled machinists and woodworkers. Introduced mechanization and machine patterns to allow precise duplication of interchangeable parts.  <font style="color:green">1880: 21,000 reapers</font> → <font style="color:blue">1885: 100,000 reapers</font>
- ==Pink collar jobs==
	- Woman and children drive down labor costs ⇒ child labor laws very ineffective
	- "Women's work": clerical/secretarial and sales (typists, filing clerks, billing clerks, store clerks), "Hello Girls" (telephone operators), manufacturing (factory job) and domestic service → [[Civil War & Reconstruction#^ac837e| Government girls]]
##### Freedom of contract & the S.C
- ==Freedom of Contract:== **labor is property, I have a property right to my labor**, I can sell it without the oversight of the state (w/in the law). Market conditions of supply and demand fix wages at a living rate, beyond that, I have the right to alienate my property any way I see fit ⇒ **PROBLEM**: causes oversupply of workers!! Freedom of contract is used to strike down laws like minimum wage, max working hours,... The market will regulate itself
	- Henry Ford argues against this and creates the [[#^e2d946|$5 day]]: if your labor force can't purchase the good you're producing, you're losing. ALTERNATE: can decrease required workforce 
- ==*Holden v. Hardy*== (1891): state creates a law stating minors can't work in a mine for > 10 hours in a day to cut accident rate down. Supreme court agrees w/ the state this time **ONLY B/C** of the danger associated w/ mining 
- ==*Lochner v. New York*== (1905): S.C rules that NY can't create a law that limits the max # of working hours for bakers (it isn't dangerous enough). Industry: 
- ==*Muller v. Oregon*== (1908): S.C upholds a law limiting the workday for women to 10 hours. One of the first cases in which the S.C recognized the importance of protecting the rights of workers. Industry: laundry
	- ==Brandeis Brief:== argument that women need to be protected so they can produce offspring 
##### Labor Unions & Strikes
- ==Knights of Labor:== organization that tried to organize a broad base of laborers (un/skilled) and eventually had a membership of 730,000, including blacks, whites, women, the Chinese, and more
- ==American Federation of Labor:== alliance of craft unions, led by Samuel Gompers, that accepted capitalism and worked to improve conditions from within, unlike the Knights of Labor, who had more radical beliefs
- ==Industrial Workers of the World:== organization that attmepted to unite unskilled workers by embracing violent tatctics and the rhetoric of class conflict & socialism
- ==International Ladies Garment Workers Union== (ILGWU): organization of mostly Jewish immigrant shirtwaist workers that is responsible for the infamous "uprising of 20,000"
- ==Women's Trade Union League== (WTUL): female-only labor organization seeking shorter working hours, better conditions, and supported strikes, that transitioned from a focus on middle class → working class women
##### Strikes
- ==Railroad Strikes== (1877): series of striking, provoked by wage cuts, layoffs, and increase in workloads, that involved workers attacking railroad property from PA to TX, ending in daily clashes between strikers & troops
- ==Railroad Strike in the SW== (1886): when railroad company owner Jay Gould refused to negotiate the end of a strike, some Knights of Labor resorted to violence before giving into Gould's asks
- ==Haymarket Riot:== protestors gathered in Haymarket Square to protest police brutality, resulting in police showing up, who arrest several activists after a bomb was detonated (anarchists)
- ==Homestead Strike:== the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers launched this strike against Homestead Steal, who hired guards to protect the factory, resulting in violence between the guards & workers
- ==Pullman Strike:== workers @ Pullman Palace Company walked out (due to the owner's refusal to negotiate wage cuts), and refused to handle any Pullman car attached to a train 
##### "New Immigrants"
- Older patterns of immigration supplanted after 1880
- **Push factors**
	- Social unrest b/c Tsars are losing power → creating power vacuum
	- Russia finally ends feudalism 
	- Italy in transition (?) phase
	- Russia's pogroms 
	- Germany trying to unify ->waves of political unrest causing Germans to leave 
- **Pull factors**
	- Relative religious freedom
	- Industrialization 
	- [[Civil War & Reconstruction#^0b9b31|Homestead Act]] (esp. attract Germans b/c its similar to farming back home)
	- ==Serial immigration== - immigrants move via word of mouth
- Italians overwhelmingly work for a few years to make money, then return home
- **Challenges**
	- Catholic/Jewism/Eastern Orthodox
	- Unfamiliar languages
	- Low-skill occupations 
	- Not used to democracy
![[Pasted image 20230209114933.png|500]]
- ==Ethnic enclaves/urban borderlands (ghettos)==: areas in which one specific ethnic group has settled → greater cultural retention, less assimilation 
- **Continued racism** 
	- [[The West#^600dcd|Chinese Exclusion Act]]
	- ==Geary Act:== forced Chinese Americans to carry a piece of paper to confirm their citizenship
##### New problems / new solutions
- American urban centers develop differently than Europe - property on edge of city is most expensive in USA **V.S** property right in the middle of the city is the most expensive in Europe

- [Jacob Riis - *How the Other Half Lives*:](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmymodernmet.com%2Fjacob-riis-how-the-other-half-lives%2F&psig=AOvVaw1A682NifKXC4GEWwMTEFk0&ust=1676048631707000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CA8QjRxqFwoTCIi3_Oz1iP0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAX) exposed the difficult life of a first-generation immigrants & wealth inequality 
- ==Political Machines:== organizations used to influence and control the political process via fraud. Found in large cities, farmed votes by helping immigrants with finding jobs,.. Even though they succeeded via illegal means, they are well-supported b/c they support the immigrants when no one else will 
- ==City Beautiful Movement:== group of women that try and fix up cities to make them pretty 
- ==Settlement House Movement:==  Group of women who tour Europe after school and create an organized effort to provide social services, education, and other assistance to the urban poor. Supported struggling immigrants, women by holding cooking classes, daycare centers, etc. [Jane Addams/Florence Kelley](https://study.com/academy/lesson/florence-kelley-jane-addams-on-child-labor.html#:~:text=Jane%20Addams%20and%20Florence%20Kelley%20were%20women%20from%20similar%20backgrounds,means%20of%20accomplishing%20these%20goals.)
##### Gilded Age Politics 
- ==Gilded age:== term coined by Mark Twain, the U.S as a nation is shiny is golden and shiny on the outside, but there is a corrupt core of decadence and even decay
- Massie voter turnout: 80% of electorate participated in elections (1870 - 1896)
- Major issues of the day: railroad regulation, Civil War pensions for Northern veterans, patronage/spoils system, tariffs and currency (gold vs. silver standard)
- Major disagreements on how best to deal w/ these issues 
##### Democrats v. Republicans
[[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^49bf0a|Democrats v. Whigs]] ← 
- [[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^c03e4a|Republicans]]: wide spectrum in the Republican party. Divisions among the Stalwarts & Half Breeds, both working the spoils system for their own benefit. Also the Mugwumps (Republicans who wanted more reform of things like civil service). The Republican faction is a **coalition** rather than a party 
	- Regional differences: Northern Republicans want the gold standard, western Republicans want silver standard
	- In general, they believed the govt. should be an agency of reform
- [[S1 Wiki(APUSH.)#^f6cdb9|Democrats]]: Northern interested in urban and economic issues, still have support of immigrants. Southern Democrats looks to defend white supremacy (still). In general, believe that governments shouldn't interfere in issues of personal liberty
	- Against regressive taxes (support income tax) → a tax that takes a larger percentage of income from low-income groups than from high-income groups **V.** supportive of progressive taxes → taxes that fuck with the rich more than the poor 
	- Against tariffs all together 
	- Silver standard

##### Police powers & opposition
- ==Policing powers:== State police powers have nothing to do w/ state police! A state has the legislative power to protect the general welfare of the population through regulation and enforcement of order. Nanny state? → building codes, quarantine laws, pure food and drug acts, control of patent medicines,..
- State laws can enforce laws on business owners to help the workers
- BUT, under the 14th amendment, businesses have the right to use their private property as they see fit. Business regulation cannot deny business profit w/o due process - according to the S.C :(
##### Railroads/pensions/civil service/tariffs/money supply
- Railroad regulation? ==*Munn v. Illinois*:== yes, grain warehouses operate in the public interest and can be regulated; ==Wabash Cases:== railroad operations between several states is interstate & cannot be regulated by a single state → Interstate Commerce Commission; ==Maximum Freight Rate Case:== limits based on the 14th amendment rights of railroads →  govt. cannot set rate 
- Pensions: no one wants to vote against pensions... but they are a huge govt. expenditure (40% of federal annual budget by 1900)
- ==Civil Service Reform:== despite advantage to political parties and machines, after President Garfield's assassination, there's huge support for the ==Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act== → provided that federal government jobs be awarded on the basis of merit and that government employees be selected through competitive exams, made it unlawful to fire or demote for political reasons employees who were covered by the law
